However a few months later, his anemia then improved enough that there was no further follow up and he was okay. This year he went back for a routine check up and his anemia is back, and worse than ever. He had another endoscopy and a colonscopy. His GI tract is normal, no gluten intolerance, nothing. His B12 and folate is also normal, and his GP no longer thinks it's related to diet/B12 deficiency. She has referred him to a hematologist. She has run a ton of blood tests, everything is normal, except for his hemoglobin, which is below normal. She is also concerned with his low total blood count. His WBC and platelets are within normal range - but at the very end of low. \\n\\nSymptoms - he has all the symptoms of anemia you'd expect.

I know we'll find out soon enough, but in the meantime, could you please suggest alternative diagnoses that aren't so scary, so I can think positively? \\n\\nHe is 50 years old, fit as an ox (bike commutes daily), eats healthy, has taken a multivitamin and a baby aspirin daily for decades, is on no other meds, and is in otherwise excellent health -- except for chronic, unexplained anemia. He has had the anemia for at least a decade.  About 5 years ago, his GP sent him for endoscopy to rule out internal bleeding. Then she put him on a course of B12 injections, that did nothing. However a few months later, his anemia then improved enough that there was no further follow up and he was okay. This year he went back for a routine check up and his anemia is back, and worse than ever. He had another endoscopy and a colonscopy. His GI tract is normal, no gluten intolerance, nothing. His B12 and folate is also normal, and his GP no longer thinks it's related to diet/B12 deficiency. She has referred him to a hematologist. She has run a ton of blood tests, everything is normal, except for his hemoglobin, which is below normal. She is also concerned with his low total blood count. His WBC and platelets are within normal range - but at the very end of low. \\n\\nSymptoms - he has all the symptoms of anemia you'd expect. Extreme fatigue, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells, sometimes short of breath, pallor, etc. He has a long history of unexplained, massive bruising (like, covering both his thighs, or his mid-torso). This comes and goes and he's never had a blood test or seen his GP during a bruising episode, but he has reported this to his doctor. On and off history of bleeding gums. And this week he admitted to me that his long bones ache. \\n\\nHe showed me his blood tests so I did see the scores,  but he then took the paperwork away from me and filed them at work. I have asked for a copy and he won't give me one,  because he knows I am prone to worry too much. He tends to worry too, and I know he is much more worried than he is letting on to me. \\n\\n</td>\n",

And he was also taking aspirin and ibu profen for migraines.\\n\\nWednesday he woke up with what he thought was a rash. Then, when he went to brush his teeth, his gums wouldn't stop bleeding. He went to the hospital and his platelets were &amp;lt;7000. (Not sure exact number because once they go under 7000, they just say &amp;lt;7000) he was given a transfusion. The rest of his CBC came back normal (WBC a slightly elevated, but was told steroids could do this) and his vitals are perfectly fine. He was also given steroids. He had a nose bleed as well from blowing his nose. \\n\\nThursday morning, the blood test revealed no change in his platelet count. He was given a sonogram of his abdomen and it came back normal. He was given a second transfusion, steroids, Benadryl and immunoglobulin.\\n\\nHe woke up today again with no change in his platelets. He is about to have his third transfusion. After that, he is going to have a second round of immunoglobulin. \\n\\nThe doctor seems to think it could be a crazy virus causing all of this. We all felt a sinking feeling when we heard his blood platelets haven't changed since after the transfusions two days in a row. I was hoping there are possibly some doctors on here or patients who have dealt with similar cases who can offer some insight and potentially other things to bring up with the dr. \\n\\nThank you everyone!\\n\\nEdit: Saturday morning still showed no signs of platelet increase. The Dr. doesn't expect his platelets to be up tomorrow because she thinks they would have already risen with this medicine if it was going to work for him. The next step is they are going to give him Rituximab starting monday, as well as transfusion and they are going to start tapering off slowly on steroids. The hematologist is going on vacation next week and Dr Vijay Shah is the hematologist that will be covering her. They cancelled a chest CT scan because they are afraid that he will sustain an injury in the process of being moved. \\n\\n2nd Edit: I figured I would update you guys on the latest. My brothers platelets did not go up over the weekend dispute 3 days of immunoglobulin and transfusions and steroids. However, on Monday they went up to 18,000 and then 37,000 on Tuesday. A CT scan showed an enlarged spleen and swollen lymph nodes throughout. On Wednesday, he woke up with blood in his mouth and his count was back down to 17,000. Thursday it was 17,000 again. Yesterday, he was given a bone marrow biopsy. Took 5 times until they could get some marrow. So that was unpleasant. He also got a bunch of bloodwork done to rule out all types of infectious diseases. His hematologist ended up speaking with a dr at a bigger hospital and he was transferred last night. We are happy with the new hospital. They seem to be working fast. Just waiting on test results.</td>\n",

Typically over 100 is considered abnormal. Assuming you are also anemic (low hematocrit or hemoglobin) there are several causes of what we call macrocytic (large cell) anemia- given your dietary and GI issues the most likely of which is vitamin B12 deficiency. But the tl:dr is that a slightly elevated MCV is not only not \"very bad\", it's not even necessarily clinically significant.\\n\\nWith that out of the way, I will say this is my personal and not professional opinion but your boyfriend sounds like kind of a jerk. You have absolute autonomy over your own body and what you put in it and you have the right to take medicine. Crohns is not a mild annoyance, it's a serious autoimmine disorder and if your boyfriend can't take that seriously (not to mention misunderstanding basic hematology) you should not be trusting him for medical advice.,Frankly, your boyfriend: (1) isn't qualified to make the sort of decisions he's making about your health, (2) isn't very knowledgeable, and (3) has no right to push you so forcefully regarding YOUR medical care.\\n\\nInflammatory bowel disease is a tricky one and everything is dependent on the severity of disease. You are fortunate to not have had any surgeries, but you say you have had multiple hospitalizations. Microbiome therapy is still in its infancy and the video you linked is currently in the research phase, not in clinical use.\\n\\nFeel free to talk to your doctor at your appointment about dietary options and other things you can try, and possibly tapering your immunosuppressants. You may be able to develop a plan with her that you feel suits you better. The key is to make sure you are well informed about the risks of stopping your current therapy, finding out whether your medicine can be ceased at once or must be stopped gradually if that is your intention, and keeping up monitoring to track disease status and progression.\\n\\nDo not be bullied into making a premature decision without knowing the risks and consequences by someone with little to no medical training. You know much better than he that Crohn's is a serious condition.\\n\\nAnd for the record, without knowing the actual numeric value I don't know exactly what you mean by \"slightly elevated\" MCV, but it's highly unlikely that it is \"very bad\". Slightly elevated MCV rarely means anything to most people.,Hopefully you ARE trusting your gastroenterologist.\\n\\nAs far as MCV, the way we calculate reference ranges means that statistically sometimes healthy people will have values that flag as abnormal. I'm always especially suspicious of this when the value is only minutely elevated. That said,  you are not a healthy person. B complex vitamin deficiencies aren't super common because they tend to be plentiful in the diet, but your GI issues are probably negatively impacting your gut's ability to absorb the vitamins. Probably the best move from here, and this is likely what your doc will suggest, is to just repeat the CBC. If it's still high, a vitamin b12 test can confirm the cause.

Worried, I showed the results to a friend with a medical background. Looking at it, he said that it looked like dehydration.

I just had my CBC taken about 8 months ago, and it came back perfectly fine.

              "      <td>My dad has mystery brain swelling and memory loss - can any doctors provide input on what to look for next?About 3 years ago, my dad began showing signs of memory and cognitive loss. It started small - he'd misplace belongings or seem unable to follow conversations, for example. Eventually he couldn't find his way home from the neighborhood store and has declined since.\\n\\nNow, at only 62 years old, he is unable to dress himself, handle personal hygiene, or hold a conversation that makes sense. All signs pointed to early onset dementia or Alzheimer's, so we took him to neurologists at UCLA where they instead discovered he has encephalopathy (brain inflammation). Blood tests have also shown he is producing a mysterious antibody called anti-recoverin, which have led doctors to believe an auto-immune reaction is causing the brain inflammation which is causing symptoms of dementia.\\n\\nMy dad has been tested for common auto-immune disorders like lupus and Celiac's disease, but nothing has been found. The antibody anti-recoverin is usually associated with cancer of the retina, but no cancer has been found and his eyes are healthy. \\n\\nWe attempted to treat my dads brain swelling with steroids and IVIG treatment at UCLA but he showed no response. The inflammation hasn't changed in at least 1.5 years. In that time we've been desperate to improve the inflammation so we've taken him to psychologists, psychiatrists, neurologists, general practitioners, holistic doctors, herbalists, and more throughout Southern California. We've tried every treatment that has been recommended and my dad has shown zero response to any of it. After countless MRI's, PET scans, SPECT brain imaging, X-rays, blood tests, testing for food allergies, and toxicities, we still have no clue what could be causing the inflammation. \\n\\nWe've tried treating his symptoms with medications for memory loss (given to patients with dementia), depression, anxiety (of which he's had both for years), natural supplements, vitamins, oils, IV vitamin and mineral therapy, nutrition and diet changes (gluten and dairy free), and hyperbaric oxygen treatment, but there has been no change.\\n\\nThe reason I'm on Reddit is because my family is at a standstill. Caring for my dad 24/7 and taking him to so many doctors has become extremely taxing on us all, including him. But we don't just want to give up. It's possible he could have SOME improvement if we just find the cause of the brain swelling. My concern is that we're looking for the wrong things. I wonder if he has a bacteria or virus that is manifesting in brain swelling when it rarely does that, so we're missing it.\\n\\nIf there are any doctors or friends of doctors out there reading who may have a idea or recommendation that I haven't mentioned above, I'd really appreciate hearing from you. If anyone knows a Dr. House or brilliant diagnostician with experience in mysterious brain reactions, I'd really appreciate hearing from you. \\n\\nThank you all. \\n\\n\\nOTHER things that may be worth mentioning: \\n-We recently discovered a lot of black mold in my parents' kitchen. But everyone else seems to be totally healthy.\\n-My dad had a severe speech impediment for which he was brutally bullied until he was 16, and due to his tough childhood he's always been a highly anxious adult.\\n-He has had chronic stomach issues since childhood (mainly low appetite, pain, and constipation) which we often attributed to his anxiety, but since eliminating gluten and dairy from his diet he seems to have improved a lot on this front\\n-My dad became extremely depressed in 2005 after a loss in the family and never quite recovered emotionally\\n-My dad lost about 30 pounds over the past 6 years, which we attributed at the time to depression. He's always been thin (6' and 150lb average) but now he is 6' and 120lb and cannot gain weight.</td>\n",

Concidering going to a better hospital?UPDATE: I did go to the recommended hospital, they were shocked at the lack of treatment received. The poor irrigation and sterilization. They agreed it was warmer than usually and just to watch it. They were abhorred by the staple job and because of my symptoms they referred me to a specialist to get an MRI after the staples are removed. Got fantastic pain relieving meds in the hospital, a script for effective medication, gauze, tape, bactrim. And a leg brace. They also agreed that filling a complaint with the other hospital was not out of line... So thanks for all your help.... Really.

It went straight in and dug under a good bit. Concerned neighbors came and talked to me and called 911 and there was my first ambulance ride... For a cut knee. \\n\\nThe driver of the ambiance was a dick, the woman with me in the back was wonderful. I immediately felt judged for being ambulance driven for a gashed knee to the ER. This thing hurt, non weight bearing, couldn't bend my leg, whole leg hurt, crying, blah blah blah, no pain medication, the radiographs were excruciating, still no pain relief, I came back wailing. Still no pain relief, I try explaining the gas plate dug in and under a good amount, at some point a PA stopped in for about 30 seconds to tell a nurse to give me Tylenol ONLY while I was there and staple it shut and send me home. No concern for a possible twisted knee or ligament/tendon/muscle damage, because again, it traveled a some distance into and under the top of my knee starting from the center at the bone.\\n\\nI literally screamed with the lidocaine injections, she was getting more frustrated, \"it's just lidocaine\", she says. I had two stitches in my thumb irrigated longer than she irrigated this mangled knee vagina, which constantly kept spewing out fatty tissue. \\n\\nShe had to cut tissue away just to be able to close it with I believe 7 staples. She was delicate and precise, problem is I felt the full pain and force of every one so when I started crying and insisting it was the truth on the third she pumped the rest in helter skelter, told me she was done and left. \\n\\nMy leg is non weight bearing, you can not touch within a good 10 inch radius of the injury and the entire leg is a bit more red and swollen and warmer than the other. If I don't more AT ALL its bearable. If I move, I cry. It takes everything I have to get out of bed if I need the rest room. And everything I have to sit on the damn toilet.

I have to keep strict form, where my knees never go over my toes, and even then I feel a slight pressure in my knee.\\n\\nI would just like to get some advice on some PT exercises I could do? Perhaps some OTC anti-inflammatory drugs I could take? I've been wearing a compression sleeve on and off and it's taken away some of the inflammation but this lingering bit is bothersome.\\n\\nThank you ahead of time :)</td>\n",

Tried taking ibuprofen/Tylenol? ,My first thoughts would definitely be light exercise. Your joints probably hurt from inflammation now not an old injury. If you don't use it for a while the muscles with shrink and the joint will be less stable. Start with low impact exercise (biking / swimming) and build up your strength and tolerance. Then make sure to use ice and just slowly build to a steady routine. The \"quick fix\" you are asking for doesn't exist. It just doesn't. Even a complete joint replacement (please don't do that) won't 100% fix things. ,Happy to help. And just because it is a last resort and definitely a point of no return. I think the body (even when semi-broken) is still a pretty damn well put together machine. We have come a long way in joint replacements but still the body adapts to trauma relatively well and can usually compensate and make things work fine. So then replacing the joint is basically another major trauma to heal from, but with foreign things.</td>\n",

              "0  Trying to get y friend to see a doctor but she wants to wait and see what happens. I'm worried sick and would like to know hat she might haveMy friend found a dime sized red lump a bit to the right of her clitoris in the shower this morning. its swollen to about 1.5cm. A little sensitive, but it doesnt hurt. The redness is isolated to the lump. I'd really like to know if it is urgent she seeks help so I can tell her so. All of what i describe is what she told me and I cant verify how accurate it is, but shes worried and im worried for her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This is most likely a Bartholin's Gland Cyst. On either side of the labia majora is a called a Bartholin's gland. Occasionally the ducts that empty the gland can become blocked causing the gland to develop a cyst. Sometimes they can go away on their own, and other times they can become infected and need to be drained by a doctor. Based on the description you gave, redness around the area it may be infected. Its nothing life threatening, but you should tell your friend to go see an OBGYN to get an examination and antibiotics.

All of what i describe is what she told me and I cant verify how accurate it is, but shes worried and im worried for her.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This is most likely a Bartholin's Gland Cyst. On either side of the labia majora is a called a Bartholin's gland. Occasionally the ducts that empty the gland can become blocked causing the gland to develop a cyst. Sometimes they can go away on their own, and other times they can become infected and need to be drained by a doctor. Based on the description you gave, redness around the area it may be infected. Its nothing life threatening, but you should tell your friend to go see an OBGYN to get an examination and antibiotics.

Unprotected sex? Penile discharge? Ulcers on the penis? ,Might be a little skin infection or a follicle somewhere then. Watch and wait I'd say, wouldn't be too worried. If it persists after a few days, increases in size, becomes red or you get multiple lumps, see a doc.,Probably an inflammed follicle.

But the answer is probably yes you should see a doctor. ,That needs to go get checked out. Have you/her been tested for STI/STD beforehand?,Probably because it's an embarrassing thing for many people to ask their real doctor. ,What about the other person? It looks suspiciously like a Syphilis chancre. ,No one knows what it is until you get tested or seen by a physician. If it is syphilis, it can be treated. If you have a planned parenthood in your area, they are quick and cheap and provide great care.                                                        Left breast pain and itchy nipple26\\n\\nFemale\\n\\n115lbs\\n\\n5\"2\\n\\nDuration: 1 month\\n\\nCurrent medication: none\\n\\nMedical issues: polycystic ovaries, IBS\\n\\nI came off the birth control pill about 6 months ago. I was on the pill for 10 years and I decided to come off as I'm not having sex with anyone at the moment. My left nipple has been incredibly itchy the last month and I get shooting pains on the left side of my chest sometimes. It's not always itchy and it comes and goes. I haven't changed detergent/deodorant recently and I'm sure I'm not pregnant. It's only ever the left nipple\\n\\nThe nipple itself looks normal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         It would be with seeing a doctor about this. Do you have an OB? It could be something as simple as an infection but that is rather odd. Is it tender to the touch? Does it feel like it's swollen around/near the area? You have not had any fevers/chills correct? ,OB is an obstetrician. OB/gyn is your typical female doctor. First thing they would do is evaluate it, possible ultrasound, also some basic labs too. And possibly offer treatment options                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             So i gave a girl oral. Couple days later she tells me shes been having vaginal pain for awhile. Then these bumps appear on my tongue and it starts to feel raw and sensitive.

The pain starts at the back of her head on the left hand side and shoot to the front and she said the pain is debilitating and horrific for about a minute, then it subsides. Yesterday, she discovered a quarter sized bump on the back of her head (low on the left side). It's tender to touch and moderately hard. Any ideas what might be going on? Thanks in advance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Shingles.  Does she feel her hair/scalp tingling?,Shingles,Call doc, describe symptoms, see if they will call in Valtrex and schedule a visit (in that order).  Since doesn't sound classic they will likely say they want to see her first.,Needs someone to take a look. Could be infected sebaceous cyst, infected hair follicle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I found a lump.It's difficult to gauge its size, because it has no protruding/defined shape and mostly just feels like a hard spot about the size of a pea on my pubis near the base of my scrotum.\\n\\nI can rule out STD's, because I'm a virgin and its been a couple days that it hasn't varied in size and/or shown particular signs of irritation, so I'm assuming it's just a clogged pore or ingrown hair.\\n\\nThoughts? It's not swollen enough for me to consider lancing it, so what can I do about it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Really impossible to say. A more full history is needed, but really a physical exam is needed as well. We spend quite a bit of time learning what normal and abnormal things look and feel like and how to describe that to each other so we know what we are talking about. Without that training it would be very difficult to try and get a solid answer over the internets. \\n\\nif it isn't red, swollen, painful, and you don't have fevers, shakes, chills, sweats, etc then it certainly isn't an emergency. The most sinister thing to consider would be cancer, but that is pretty low on the differential given what you said. \\n\\nIf it gets red, swollen, painful, etc go have it checked out. If it is an ingrown hair or small site of infection it will most likely clear on its own, but it could become an abscess and require incision and drainage. Don't wait too long to be seen after symptoms appear (really, you should be seen within 24 hours of any symptoms) because the infection could spread rapidly and cause huge problems. \\n\\nIf it stays the same or goes away, then it is most likely not something to worry about. If it changes - gets larger, lumpier, more irregular, changes color, or you see more of them popping up... go see a doctor. ,No worries. Just playing the odds it is probably nothing. Just keep an eye on it and make sure things don't go awry.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Do I have testicular cancer?!Hey, I am really scared that I have testicular cancer. I noticed a lump that just formed this past 3 hours on my scrotum infront of my right testicle. It's more like swelling skin and if have had this happen before because of hives that got to my scrotum. My scrotum was normal yesterday and this morning, but I am getting scared to think I have testicular cancer. I did have a fever today and so I took some Advil and Ibuprofen. Is the swelling an effect of that or do I have testicular cancer? I am 16 and I am really scared                                                                                                       I understand you have a swelling on your scrotal skin which formed in 3 hours? That's not testicular cancer, but I can't examine you over the internet. Visit a doctor.,No, if it goes away, you shouldn't be worried. But as you state that you are really scared, the reassurance of an actual doctor is probably better than the reassurance of one over the internet. You don't have to visit a doctor right now, just make an appointment to see one sometime in the next couple of days if the swelling persists.

It also looks a bit like a burn. If it's not bothering her, just leave it alone, maybe cover it with some vaseline or something. If it spreads or gets bigger or she develops more, it might be worth an appointment with her primary care physician.

              "1  Ease my worries pleaseMy husband is about to see a hematologist and googling around has me worried that he's got something serious, like aplastic anemia. I know we'll find out soon enough, but in the meantime, could you please suggest alternative diagnoses that aren't so scary, so I can think positively? \\n\\nHe is 50 years old, fit as an ox (bike commutes daily), eats healthy, has taken a multivitamin and a baby aspirin daily for decades, is on no other meds, and is in otherwise excellent health -- except for chronic, unexplained anemia. He has had the anemia for at least a decade.  About 5 years ago, his GP sent him for endoscopy to rule out internal bleeding. Then she put him on a course of B12 injections, that did nothing. However a few months later, his anemia then improved enough that there was no further follow up and he was okay. This year he went back for a routine check up and his anemia is back, and worse than ever. He had another endoscopy and a colonscopy. His GI tract is normal, no gluten intolerance, nothing. His B12 and folate is also normal, and his GP no longer thinks it's related to diet/B12 deficiency. She has referred him to a hematologist. She has run a ton of blood tests, everything is normal, except for his hemoglobin, which is below normal. She is also concerned with his low total blood count. His WBC and platelets are within normal range - but at the very end of low. \\n\\nSymptoms - he has all the symptoms of anemia you'd expect. Extreme fatigue, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells, sometimes short of breath, pallor, etc. He has a long history of unexplained, massive bruising (like, covering both his thighs, or his mid-torso). This comes and goes and he's never had a blood test or seen his GP during a bruising episode, but he has reported this to his doctor. On and off history of bleeding gums. And this week he admitted to me that his long bones ache. \\n\\nHe showed me his blood tests so I did see the scores,  but he then took the paperwork away from me and filed them at work. I have asked for a copy and he won't give me one,  because he knows I am prone to worry too much. He tends to worry too, and I know he is much more worried than he is letting on to me. \\n\\n  Would be helpful with the exact values of the CBC. And B12, Folate and Ferritin values.\\n\\nAre liver and kidney function tests okay?\\n\\nWhat are his ethnic origins?,Is he diabetic. Does he take any other medication?,Does he take aspirin?\\nDid he test for fecal blood?,But even tested, to me it looks like the most potential culprit. Fecal blood tests are not very good and even low doses ASA can result in micro hemorrhage that could potentially lead to this chronic anemia. \\n\\nHis RDW could help in this analysis. ,Please, make sure to update here in case of any news.,As for ms and anemia, the most common us confusion between pernicious anemia and ms. I may be missing something, but can't really see a clear connection. \\nI am a family physician in Brazil, we follow strict guidelines for high-costing procedures. I really can't follow the rationale for the MRI, but I could be wrong and missing something of the big picture here. \\nI understand - if that's the case - that a bone marrow examination could be WAY more cost-efficient now. \\n\\nBut seriously, I am still bugged by that aspirin. :-),It's funny how we men are harder to one about symptoms and other health issues, I wish you the best of luck. \\nIf, as results come, I can be of any help, do not hesitate in calling again.

My brother (35/M) is in the hospital with ITP. He is on his third transfusion and second round of immunoglobulin with no difference in his platelet count. Advice?Hi everyone,\\n\\nI am writing with concerns about my brother's condition. My brother had the flu and then a sinus infection back to back. He was on tami flu and then clarithromycin. And he was also taking aspirin and ibu profen for migraines.\\n\\nWednesday he woke up with what he thought was a rash. Then, when he went to brush his teeth, his gums wouldn't stop bleeding. He went to the hospital and his platelets were &lt;7000. (Not sure exact number because once they go under 7000, they just say &lt;7000) he was given a transfusion. The rest of his CBC came back normal (WBC a slightly elevated, but was told steroids could do this) and his vitals are perfectly fine. He was also given steroids. He had a nose bleed as well from blowing his nose. \\n\\nThursday morning, the blood test revealed no change in his platelet count. He was given a sonogram of his abdomen and it came back normal. He was given a second transfusion, steroids, Benadryl and immunoglobulin.\\n\\nHe woke up today again with no change in his platelets. He is about to have his third transfusion. After that, he is going to have a second round of immunoglobulin. \\n\\nThe doctor seems to think it could be a crazy virus causing all of this. We all felt a sinking feeling when we heard his blood platelets haven't changed since after the transfusions two days in a row. I was hoping there are possibly some doctors on here or patients who have dealt with similar cases who can offer some insight and potentially other things to bring up with the dr. \\n\\nThank you everyone!\\n\\nEdit: Saturday morning still showed no signs of platelet increase. The Dr. doesn't expect his platelets to be up tomorrow because she thinks they would have already risen with this medicine if it was going to work for him. The next step is they are going to give him Rituximab starting monday, as well as transfusion and they are going to start tapering off slowly on steroids. The hematologist is going on vacation next week and Dr Vijay Shah is the hematologist that will be covering her. They cancelled a chest CT scan because they are afraid that he will sustain an injury in the process of being moved. \\n\\n2nd Edit: I figured I would update you guys on the latest. My brothers platelets did not go up over the weekend dispute 3 days of immunoglobulin and transfusions and steroids. However, on Monday they went up to 18,000 and then 37,000 on Tuesday. A CT scan showed an enlarged spleen and swollen lymph nodes throughout. On Wednesday, he woke up with blood in his mouth and his count was back down to 17,000. Thursday it was 17,000 again. Yesterday, he was given a bone marrow biopsy. Took 5 times until they could get some marrow. So that was unpleasant. He also got a bunch of bloodwork done to rule out all types of infectious diseases. His hematologist ended up speaking with a dr at a bigger hospital and he was transferred last night. We are happy with the new hospital. They seem to be working fast. Just waiting on test results.   stumped; I hope a Heme-onc or intensivist reads this board who can help you.,RemindMe! 1 week \"ITP case\",Not uncommon. Platelets would not be expected to make the platelet count go up, they just get eaten up the same way his native platelets are. We try not to give platelets to people with ITP unless they are bleeding and have severely low counts (and it sounds like your brother met both of those). \\n\\nHis counts haven't recovered yet despite treatment, and that's obviously not what we want, but I don't know if he is refractory to treatment just yet, sometimes it takes a little longer. There are also additional therapies that can be tried, but the options may depend on what kind of hospital you are at.,I've been a little busy. How are things going if you don't mind me asking?,Good to hear. Sounds like there's a good plan in place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The doctor says it's probably normal for me, but on the Internet im hearing a different story.[deleted]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You're not in any age/race group that is likely to get any sort of bleeding disorder or leukemia. Your CBC is also pretty normal in every other value and you have no other symptoms. No easy bruising or bleeding from your nose. So yeah, your doctor is being pretty responsible, it looks like it's normal for you but it's best to run a few more tests. He'll probably order some platelet function tests and a peripheral blood smear. (Also don't listen to everything on the internet, like your doctor said, it could be normal for you, your body adapted to producing low platelets.)                        Apart from Cancer and Polyps, would could be learned by a Colonoscopy?I've recently become carer for my Dad, deets below. We went to the doctor this morning, and she's referred him for a colonoscopy because his haemaglobin has dropped to 90 from 125. \\n\\nHe absolutely refuses to go. He said all the right things to the doctor, but when we left he told me he's absolutely not going. His reasoning is that it's checking for cancer, which he won't treat anyway, or polyps, which he won't treat because he refuses to have another operation.\\n\\nNow, I totally understand his reasoning*, but I'm treading a fine line and I basically need to pick my battles. So I'm wondering if there's something else the procedure would show that would be treated without surgery or chemotherapy?\\n\\n52\\nM\\n&gt;160cm\\n150kg\\nCaucasian\\nUnsure - no blood in faeces but test previous to this was 3-4 months ago, so the drop has been since then\\nExisting medical issues - you sure you got time for this?

He's been in chronic pain for 40 years, and I've had to become his carer because he lets his cellulitis flare so badly that he goes into septic shock because he simply doesn't want to live in pain anymore. If fixing the haemaglobin issue means taking a couple more pills, he'll do it; but if it's anything invasive, there's really no way he's gonna do it because there's literally zero benefit to him at this point.  Well, the simple answer would be that a GI doctor would be performing the colonscopy looking for causes of bleeding in the lower intestinal tract.  The two main things that could be causing this in your father's case would be colorectal cancer or polyps with that dramatic drop in hemoglobin or bleeding from his Aspirin therapy for prevention after this stroke (although Aspirin is more likely to make you bleed from your upper GI tract and stomach).\\n\\nOther things that don't require surgery or chemotherapy that could be treated with medications or theoretically being causing blood loss anemia and could be identified by a colonoscopy would be [diverticulitis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulitis), [ulcerative colitis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis), [angiodysplasia] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiodysplasia), [collagenous colitis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagenous_colitis).\\n\\nThere are probably others.  Cancer and polyps are the main reason, but there are still lots of useful things that can be found and treated on colonoscopy, especially in a relatively young man like your father.

I'm pretty pale but the skin inside of my eyelids is red and I have color everywhere else, but I have dark undereye circles that have been there since childhood(probably from allergies). Now, I am a dancer so I tend to throw my body all over the place on a hard floor, so I am used to seeing bruises on  y shins and knees, but I've been getting small green bruises on places like my outer thigh, inner thigh, calf, and hamstring and I'm getting concerned. I don't have night sweats or feel fatigued, but my gums do bleed a little when I brush and I have a little blood in the tissue when I blow my nose after I wake up. My periods are painful and *kind of* heavy. I have some shin pain but that is probably from dancing. I'm a bit of a space cadet mentally sometimes. I haven't been eating much red meat or meat in general other than some chicken or fish lately, is it possible that I'm just anemic? should I eat more red meat to see if that helps?

Please go get a basic blood test.  I say this as a doc because you could have low platelets caused by a number of things.  I hope you follow through on this.  It's probably not anything that is fixable on your own if you are having the problems that you say you are and they are extensive.  Don't message me back.  Go get checked out.,Family doc here, agree completely with barmal.  \\n\\nYou need to get your blood cells and platelets checked to proceed any further.\\n\\nThe likelihood of leukemia is still low, but catastrophic processes have to be ruled out first.\\n\\nIt's much more likely to be a benign condition like idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura that might not need treatment but needs to be assessed and followed.\\n\\nAnemia itself isn't really a medical diagnosis, it's more of a test result showing low red blood cells.  There are lots of types of anemia, and if it is found, you need to see a doctor to try to determine the cause.  And most routine causes of anemia shouldn't make you bruise.,I just didn't want you thinking that was a replacement for an appt.  You are on the right track with anemia.  Take care!,Could be from dancing but no way to prove it.  A simple blood test will rule out a whole bunch of horrible diseases.    I have severe crohn's and my boyfriend wants me to stop taking immune suppressants. Is this possible?Let me start by apologizing for the wall of texts. Also, this isn't just about medicine. Medicine is clearly involved, but my relationship is also factoring in. I apologize for that too.  \\n\\nI am 29, white female, 5'5, 110-150lbs (depending on health), I was diagnosed with severe crohn's disease 12 years ago. No surgeries related to crohns. My worst flare was about three years ago. I had four hospitalizations in one year and it took another year and a half of recovering and coming off of prednisone and pain killers. I have been on remicade, humira, imuran, and cimzia. I am now taking 100mg of imuran every day and 400 mg of cimzia every three weeks. I also take calcium, vitamin D, and medical cannabis. I only take pain medications when I flare up and refuse to take them for anything else. \\n\\nStarted seeing a guy about a month ago. He's an emt and a massage therapist. He has studied a lot of natural medicines and hates pharmicutical companies. I actually really like him, except he is pushing me very hard to stop the immune suppressants. I don't care for his arrogance on this topic, but I do think he is right about the immune suppressants harming me in the long run.\\n\\nI get sick all the time and it takes a very long time to get better. I have bone loss from the prednisone and my heart rate stays around 100. Doctors have said that even though I seem to be doing well right now, I will never be in remission. My latest blood test showed my MCV levels to be slightly elevated, but I'm not sure what that really means yet. Boyfriend just says it's very bad and scares me about it. \\n\\nThe crohn's and colitis foundation has an article on their website about treating crohns through diet and microbiome therapy (website: http://www.ccfa.org/research/current-research-studies/microbiome-video.html). There is no reference to taking immune suppressants with this form of treatment. However, since reading this I started taking boswellia and all-zyme pills given to me by my boyfriend.\\n\\nI am interested in finding a healthier diet for myself and am researching options. I have really only known clear liquid diets and building up what I can eat again for the last 12 years. Definitely do not have the healthiest diet because of it. \\n\\nIn two week I have my next appointment with my gastro doc. I would like to bring up this study and ask her if it would be possible to start this other type of treatment and only use the immune suppressants like I use pain killers (during flares and to control a flare).  While I am serious about making changes, my boyfriend pushing me to stop the immune suppressants quickly. We had a major fight about it yesterday. I am stressing out over this. I guess I don't know if I need medical advice or a counselor. I don't think I can make it another two weeks of being pushed like this. Please help somebody.  I'm sorry I can't help you with the pharmaceutical part but you should know that MCV, mean corpuscular volume, is just a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. Typically over 100 is considered abnormal. Assuming you are also anemic (low hematocrit or hemoglobin) there are several causes of what we call macrocytic (large cell) anemia- given your dietary and GI issues the most likely of which is vitamin B12 deficiency. But the tl:dr is that a slightly elevated MCV is not only not \"very bad\", it's not even necessarily clinically significant.\\n\\nWith that out of the way, I will say this is my personal and not professional opinion but your boyfriend sounds like kind of a jerk. You have absolute autonomy over your own body and what you put in it and you have the right to take medicine. Crohns is not a mild annoyance, it's a serious autoimmine disorder and if your boyfriend can't take that seriously (not to mention misunderstanding basic hematology) you should not be trusting him for medical advice.,Frankly, your boyfriend: (1) isn't qualified to make the sort of decisions he's making about your health, (2) isn't very knowledgeable, and (3) has no right to push you so forcefully regarding YOUR medical care.\\n\\nInflammatory bowel disease is a tricky one and everything is dependent on the severity of disease. You are fortunate to not have had any surgeries, but you say you have had multiple hospitalizations. Microbiome therapy is still in its infancy and the video you linked is currently in the research phase, not in clinical use.\\n\\nFeel free to talk to your doctor at your appointment about dietary options and other things you can try, and possibly tapering your immunosuppressants. You may be able to develop a plan with her that you feel suits you better. The key is to make sure you are well informed about the risks of stopping your current therapy, finding out whether your medicine can be ceased at once or must be stopped gradually if that is your intention, and keeping up monitoring to track disease status and progression.\\n\\nDo not be bullied into making a premature decision without knowing the risks and consequences by someone with little to no medical training. You know much better than he that Crohn's is a serious condition.\\n\\nAnd for the record, without knowing the actual numeric value I don't know exactly what you mean by \"slightly elevated\" MCV, but it's highly unlikely that it is \"very bad\". Slightly elevated MCV rarely means anything to most people.,Hopefully you ARE trusting your gastroenterologist.\\n\\nAs far as MCV, the way we calculate reference ranges means that statistically sometimes healthy people will have values that flag as abnormal. I'm always especially suspicious of this when the value is only minutely elevated. That said,  you are not a healthy person. B complex vitamin deficiencies aren't super common because they tend to be plentiful in the diet, but your GI issues are probably negatively impacting your gut's ability to absorb the vitamins. Probably the best move from here, and this is likely what your doc will suggest, is to just repeat the CBC. If it's still high, a vitamin b12 test can confirm the cause. Vitamin B12 shits can reverse the anemia quite effectively.  Can a doctor explain to me what an abnormal blood clotting time could mean?I take no meds except for a multi vitamin. I had blood labs done and my doc said that my blood clotting times were \"slow\", as if I was on blood thinners, which I am not. Also said Vit D levels were low which is weird because I just spent a week on vacation on the beach. She really wants me to see a hematologist and got me a referral for one. They have since taken even more blood labs and haven't told me anything except just to make the appointment with the hematologist and then follow up with her after. should I be worried? What could I possibly have to see a specialist for?  You could have a genetic defect that prevents your blood from clotting normally. \\n\\nYou could either clot too fast or not clot fast enough.\\n\\nYou're probably getting more tests for hemophilla which occurs mostly in men.\\n\\nIt would be good to ask all old people in your family if they remember anyone with a blood clotting problem..... grandma's brothers, mom's brother's and such.\\n\\nAlso you need a repeat test to make sure it wasn't a lab error.\\n\\nYes you need a hematologist. \\n\\nhttp://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/basics/definition/con-20029824,Why did your doctor order clotting tests?  Elevated CBC results along with elevated blood albumin. New primary care doc wants me to see a hematologist, but friend with medical background says it's probably just dehydration and to retake in a month. What do I do?Age - 27\\nSex - M\\nHeight - 6'0\\nWeight - 201\\n\\nI recently saw a doctor for bubbles/foam I was having in my urine for a couple of months. He did a urine test and blood test. In the urine test, he found 1+ protein along with trace amounts of albumin and bilirubin. He thought I was dehydrated, but wanted to wait for the blood test. My blood pressure was slightly elevated (130 over 80) and heart rate was 110 (I'm fairly scared of the doctor's office). \\n\\nAll kidney results came in normal, but parts of my RBC and albumin were elevated:\\n\\nAlbumin - 5.4 High (3.6-5.1)\\nAlbumin/Globulin Ratio - 2.6 High (1.0-2.5)\\nRed Blood Cell Count 5.88 High (4.2-5.8)\\nHemoglobin - 17.2 High (13.2-17.1)\\nHematocrit - 52.2 High (38.5-50)\\n\\nThe thing is my air conditioner has been broken, and it's summer in a very hot, humid state. I didn't know if I could drink water before the test, so I sort of sat around in my house sweating while waiting for the air conditioner people to arrive. Even when it came time to give a urine sample, I had to ask to drink some water and even then could barely get much out (it was a pretty pronounced yellow/orange). That means the time I had my last drink of water was around 9 or 10 the previous day, and I had my blood drawn at noon the next. \\n\\nAnyway, their office called me wanting me to see a hematologist. Worried, I showed the results to a friend with a medical background. Looking at it, he said that it looked like dehydration. When I looked it up online myself, too, elevated blood albumin is almost always related to dehydration, and dehydration would also cause these results to read a little high. I just had my CBC taken about 8 months ago, and it came back perfectly fine. My friend suggested I retake the CBC alone in a few weeks after my air conditioner is fixed and when I've made sure to stay hydrated. Then, if they still come back as off, go see the hematologist. Is the elevation really that extreme, or is it quite innocuous?\\n\\nNote: I do have a mitral valve prolapse, but when I got my check-up with my cardiologist last year, he said it hadn't changed in the past 7 years. \\n\\nWhat are your thoughts? \\n\\n\\n  Do you smoke?\\n\\nDo you live at altitude?\\n\\nIf you just showed me the results, I would agree with your friend.  They are not markedly off normal to say \"oh yeah badness going on here\".  I agree repeating it with some better hydration opportunity may be the better course of valor.\\n\\nIf your doc is referring for some other reason that we are not seeing here, then I would say you need to communicate that with the doctor so you have an understanding.  \\n\\nOftentimes when you go the hematologist, they will ask \"so why are you here?\" and you need be able to verbalize that clearly.  You shouldn't *have* to do this, but unfortunately this is how it sometimes goes.,Ok.  Im sticking with my answer.  I would negotiate a recheck under better conditions.  If I was a hematologist, thats the first test I would order, a repeat after a period of time.  If its 'bad' it tends to worsen with time.  If its 'fine' then it tends to get better over time.  My dad has mystery brain swelling and memory loss - can any doctors provide input on what to look for next?About 3 years ago, my dad began showing signs of memory and cognitive loss. It started small - he'd misplace belongings or seem unable to follow conversations, for example. Eventually he couldn't find his way home from the neighborhood store and has declined since.\\n\\nNow, at only 62 years old, he is unable to dress himself, handle personal hygiene, or hold a conversation that makes sense. All signs pointed to early onset dementia or Alzheimer's, so we took him to neurologists at UCLA where they instead discovered he has encephalopathy (brain inflammation). Blood tests have also shown he is producing a mysterious antibody called anti-recoverin, which have led doctors to believe an auto-immune reaction is causing the brain inflammation which is causing symptoms of dementia.\\n\\nMy dad has been tested for common auto-immune disorders like lupus and Celiac's disease, but nothing has been found. The antibody anti-recoverin is usually associated with cancer of the retina, but no cancer has been found and his eyes are healthy. \\n\\nWe attempted to treat my dads brain swelling with steroids and IVIG treatment at UCLA but he showed no response. The inflammation hasn't changed in at least 1.5 years. In that time we've been desperate to improve the inflammation so we've taken him to psychologists, psychiatrists, neurologists, general practitioners, holistic doctors, herbalists, and more throughout Southern California. We've tried every treatment that has been recommended and my dad has shown zero response to any of it. After countless MRI's, PET scans, SPECT brain imaging, X-rays, blood tests, testing for food allergies, and toxicities, we still have no clue what could be causing the inflammation. \\n\\nWe've tried treating his symptoms with medications for memory loss (given to patients with dementia), depression, anxiety (of which he's had both for years), natural supplements, vitamins, oils, IV vitamin and mineral therapy, nutrition and diet changes (gluten and dairy free), and hyperbaric oxygen treatment, but there has been no change.\\n\\nThe reason I'm on Reddit is because my family is at a standstill. Caring for my dad 24/7 and taking him to so many doctors has become extremely taxing on us all, including him. But we don't just want to give up. It's possible he could have SOME improvement if we just find the cause of the brain swelling. My concern is that we're looking for the wrong things. I wonder if he has a bacteria or virus that is manifesting in brain swelling when it rarely does that, so we're missing it.\\n\\nIf there are any doctors or friends of doctors out there reading who may have a idea or recommendation that I haven't mentioned above, I'd really appreciate hearing from you. If anyone knows a Dr. House or brilliant diagnostician with experience in mysterious brain reactions, I'd really appreciate hearing from you. \\n\\nThank you all. \\n\\n\\nOTHER things that may be worth mentioning: \\n-We recently discovered a lot of black mold in my parents' kitchen. But everyone else seems to be totally healthy.\\n-My dad had a severe speech impediment for which he was brutally bullied until he was 16, and due to his tough childhood he's always been a highly anxious adult.\\n-He has had chronic stomach issues since childhood (mainly low appetite, pain, and constipation) which we often attributed to his anxiety, but since eliminating gluten and dairy from his diet he seems to have improved a lot on this front\\n-My dad became extremely depressed in 2005 after a loss in the family and never quite recovered emotionally\\n-My dad lost about 30 pounds over the past 6 years, which we attributed at the time to depression. He's always been thin (6' and 150lb average) but now he is 6' and 120lb and cannot gain weight.  Has plasmapheresis been tried as a treatment? If you've tried everything else it may be worth a shot. I've seen some patients with paraneoplastic syndromes who have received benefit from it but others who have not.\\n\\nOn that note, you say your father has tested positive for anti-recoverin. I'm assuming that he was tested for a variety of paraneoplastic antibodies, like the ones in [this panel](http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/Overview/83380). Is that the case?\\n\\nCheck out [this website](https://aealliance.org/) and see if it sounds similar to what the doctors you've seen are telling you. I can't give you a diagnosis and I don't know what all has been investigated in your father's case, but you may be able to find some information here to discuss with your father's doctor.\n",
              "2  Severe shoulder, neck and back pain after tetanus vaccinationA little less than a week ago I received my tetanus booster shot (the one you receive every decade, at least here in Australia).\\n\\nA few days later I began experiencing pain around my shoulder blade. This has been progressively getting worse, culminating this evening in a stiff neck and severe pain on my upper left back. It got to the point tonight where I could not move from a lying down position without my wife's assistance, and even then, the pain was excruciating. \\n\\nFrom what I've read, such a degree of pain days after the injection is unusual, but not unheard of. As it didn't click initially that my symptoms were related to the tetanus shot, I began treating it like a sports injury and have tried rest and ice. The ice tonight is what made it so bad. I have, therefore hit the pain killers and heat treatment. \\n\\nHow long can I expect this to last? Is there anything else I can do to hasten recovery and relieve pain? \\n\\nThanks in advance.

You don't have to go see a doctor, he or she can't do anything about it. A sore spot is quite common after a flu shot (mine was also quite mean this year). paracetamol is fine, ice can numb the pain a little. It will go away in a few days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            My lower back hurts like hellI lifted something heavy and I stupidly lifted with my back instead of my legs and now my lower back is in a lot of pain. It hurts to walk and lie down and sit up. What's the best treatment for this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Ibuprofen,Where is this 2-3 day coming from?\\n,Wow was that a biased editorial I just read.  Anyway, I've seen some *human* data on long bone fractures and NSAIDs that showed a possible decrease in healing but it was of questionable significance.  There is probably enough data to say - don't use ibuprofen after your back doesn't hurt anymore.  If that's more than 2-3 days.. I don't know that there's enough there to say well now you're magically causing harm at 48 hours.,Agree.. There has been a shift                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Shoulder sore 6 hours after vaccination.[deleted]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          If you're still sore in a few days go back to your doc. You just got three inoculations, your shoulder is going to be sore for a bit. Don't panic or self diagnose anything. ,Which shots specifically? The tetanus vaccine commonly leaves people feeling sore for a day or two. I've heard that the HPV vaccine also does.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Sprained ankle, can't walk at all and 500mg naproxen not helpingI twisted my ankle yesterday and had to leave school early. When I got to the hospital they did an xray and said it wasn't a fracture than my doctor prescribed naproxen for the next few weeks and gave me an ace bandage.\\n\\nI didn't get crutches, a boot, or even a wheelchair, and I was never asked how much it hurt. \\n\\nThe pain is so bad it makes me cry, and kept me awake last night. I woke up and the bandage had come off, and it took an hour to get it back on because it hurts even if I'm just moving my leg and not my ankle. \\n\\nWhat can I do? Should I call and complain, or attempt to go back and do it in person. I feel like there might have been some incompetence in my doctors decisions, and that I should have gotten at least something to help me move.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You took ibuprofen as well as naproxen? ,Take some paracetamol too. 1000mg every 4-6 hours. ,Put a brace on.,Just popping in to agree that you should definitely not be taking both ibuprofen and naproxen! They're both NSAIDs and may cause internal bleeding and GI ulceration. That being said, what your doctor prescribed is the best option for a sprain as it reduces pain and inflammation. More important, though,  is the RICE technique a couple others have mentioned. Be sure not to exceed daily recommended dosing for your pain medications, as it likely won't help much more with pain and will have additional side effects. ,This ^ ,This ^ Yes, sorry for the delay. Hectic day..\\n\\nTake a NSAID (either Naproxen **or** ibuprofen) and also take some paracetamol (Tylenol)\\n\\nBest not to take your chosen NSAID and paracetamol at the same time - Not because it's dangerous, but because if you space these out and alternate between drugs, it will manage your pain better - Example...take your dose of ibuprofen/naproxen, then 2-3 hours later take some Tylenol, 2-3 hours later more ibuprofen/naproxen...2-3 hours later more paracetamol ...and so on)\\nDoing this should provide consistent pain relief all day and through the night.\\n\\nI hope this makes sense. Take care. \\n\\n\\n  Pinched Nerve in NeckHello I’m a 19 year old Caucasian male. Im 5’5” and weigh 140 lbs.I pinched a nerve in my neck earlier lifting weights. I turned my head to the left too quickly and I felt a quick pain. This was 6 hours ago and the pain has no subsided. It seems to be located on the left side of my neck as this location has the most discomfort. Earlier I was able to keep my head up straight but now it’s leaning to the right because of the discomfort. I have no previous history of any medical conditions nor am I on any medication. Any advice on easing this pain, and/or allowing my neck to at least straighten up to appear normal?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    You didn't pinch a nerve, you actually strained your neck muscle. It's very common and it happened to me once or twice with very severe pain.  Best thing to do is to rest the area and take tylenol+advil.  It will get better on its own in a few days. If after a week it's not getting better or getting worse, see your GP.\\n\\nhope this helped                                                                                                                             Terrible hospital experience when recieving 7 staples in my knee. Concidering going to a better hospital?UPDATE: I did go to the recommended hospital, they were shocked at the lack of treatment received. The poor irrigation and sterilization. They agreed it was warmer than usually and just to watch it. They were abhorred by the staple job and because of my symptoms they referred me to a specialist to get an MRI after the staples are removed. Got fantastic pain relieving meds in the hospital, a script for effective medication, gauze, tape, bactrim. And a leg brace. They also agreed that filling a complaint with the other hospital was not out of line... So thanks for all your help.... Really. (¬､¬)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOriginal post:\\n\\nToday I was walking in the grass and did not anticipate a ditch that had me fall and shove my knee full force into the edge of a gas pipe tap between the sidewalk and the yard, straight to the bone. It went straight in and dug under a good bit. Concerned neighbors came and talked to me and called 911 and there was my first ambulance ride... For a cut knee. \\n\\nThe driver of the ambiance was a dick, the woman with me in the back was wonderful. I immediately felt judged for being ambulance driven for a gashed knee to the ER. This thing hurt, non weight bearing, couldn't bend my leg, whole leg hurt, crying, blah blah blah, no pain medication, the radiographs were excruciating, still no pain relief, I came back wailing. Still no pain relief, I try explaining the gas plate dug in and under a good amount, at some point a PA stopped in for about 30 seconds to tell a nurse to give me Tylenol ONLY while I was there and staple it shut and send me home. No concern for a possible twisted knee or ligament/tendon/muscle damage, because again, it traveled a some distance into and under the top of my knee starting from the center at the bone.\\n\\nI literally screamed with the lidocaine injections, she was getting more frustrated, \"it's just lidocaine\", she says. I had two stitches in my thumb irrigated longer than she irrigated this mangled knee vagina, which constantly kept spewing out fatty tissue. \\n\\nShe had to cut tissue away just to be able to close it with I believe 7 staples. She was delicate and precise, problem is I felt the full pain and force of every one so when I started crying and insisting it was the truth on the third she pumped the rest in helter skelter, told me she was done and left. \\n\\nMy leg is non weight bearing, you can not touch within a good 10 inch radius of the injury and the entire leg is a bit more red and swollen and warmer than the other. If I don't more AT ALL its bearable. If I move, I cry. It takes everything I have to get out of bed if I need the rest room. And everything I have to sit on the damn toilet. Everyone keeps telling me I went to the wrong hospital and should have gone to a  specific other one in the next county over.\\n\\nSo do I try an urgent care center if it's excruciating tomorrow like this or do I go to the recommended hospital?\\n\\nI feel like what they did was on some levels inhumane. I've been told by multiple persons a complaint would be appropriate action. This is older men and women who are were RNs and 911 operators.\\n\\nI'm 27 y/o 5'9\" female 250lbs and nothing else really relevant.\\n\\nThanks..  What was inhumane? What did you expect? A hug? Morphine? I don't know if I'm missing something here?\\n\\nWhat's with all the deleted comments below? ,If it wasn't irrigated properly, then obviously they've done wrong. But for the most part, it just sounds like you were panicked and distressed. Perhaps I'm picturing something far more innocuous than it was though. ,You hurt yourself, and it's not going to be painless healing. If you are still in pain, take some Ibuprofen (prescription NSAIDs would just be a higher dosage ibuprofen, most likely). I'm sure that they verified on the imaging that it hadn't damaged the bone and other tissues. My only other worry would be to make sure your tetanus immunization was up-to-date, which I'm sure they did as well. At this point, another doctor isn't going to do anything to help, because you just need time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Girlfriend and I were just rear-ended. Definitely feeling it in our necks. Should we be worried about doing anything wrong to make it worse?So, we'll be seeing a doctor tomorrow probably. This is mainly for tonight and a bit of tomorrow. We got rear-ended about two hours ago. Our necks are sore. We felt a small bit of pressure in our ears and now have some headaches. She's concerned of concussion type issues. I'm not so sure. We just want to make sure that we're cool for the night by just taking it easy and laying low. Thanks for the advice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            My immediate guess would be whiplash. Back and/or neck pain following a road traffic accident always warrants a doctors visit - so make sure you both make that appointment tomorrow. If it does turn out to be whiplash, the treatment for is fairly conservative. Painkillers and gentle neck exercises. \\n\\nUnfortunately, injuries like these get worse before they get better. I would recommend you both take some paracetamol and/or ibuprofen now, if you haven't already.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I was bitten by a dog 3 weeks ago the dog was quarantined and showed no sings of rabies, but my arm still hurts and feels like it's burning .As the title said I was bitten by a dog 3 weeks ago and the dog was quarantined and showed no sings of rabies, but my arm still hurts and feels like it's burning, also I have random twitching muscles in my left leg, I was bitten in my right arm. Right under my elbow. \\nI would put a picture but you can't see it any more it's fully healed. Should I worry ? Or is it that the my muscles are still repairing the selfs ? \\nSorry for any spelling errors . :)                                                              Were you prescribed antibiotics at the time of the injury?\\n\\nWhen was your last tetanus shot?

I'm randomly in immense pain after I was seemingly doing fine. Whats going on?I am a 22 y/o male\\n5'11\\n180 lbs\\nwhite\\nThis has been going on for a few hours now\\ncurrent medicine: hydrocodone 5\\n\\nThe first week of recovery was fine, they took the stitches out and said the incision was healing nicely. They put a cast on (which surprisingly was less restricting than the thumb spike brace I had on for recovery) and its been exactly a week with the cast. I work where its almost impossible to not use my hand so unfortunately i've been using it a bit, but it hasn't really bothered me too much. This morning I noticed my fingers were a bit stiff and as the day progressed they began to hurt to the point where it hurt to grab anything with it (its now at its worst where I cant even button my pants and its even hard to type this). about 4 hours ago my wrist started hurting as well, but not just the side I got surgery on. My entire wrist hurts as well as the part where the scaphoid is. Even with just keeping it still while elevated above my heart for an hour there is pain but when moving it the pain worsens. Unfortunately I have a really high tolerance to pain meds so my hydrocodone doesn't really get rid of the pain.\\n\\nAny help is greatly appreciated. This hurts really bad\\n\\nEdit: Now most of the pain is on the opposite part of my wrist and really flares up when I move my fingers up... I feel like I'm going crazy because this has never happened to me before..                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  This sounds very bad. You would rate your pain a 10 out of 10, yes? You should go to an emergency room. Go now!!!,It's good that the pain has diminished. I was jumping to the worst case scenario, which is an infection. I would still go see a doctor as soon as possible to rule out infection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
              "3  Knee problemHere's the run down.  This past weekend my wife and I took part in a 3-day walk for breast cancer.  It was 60 miles, so clearly a lot of work on my knees.  Day 1 went fine, feet hurt, but to be expected.  Day two came and I was having issues with my right foot's arch.  So I am assuming I was compensating my leg around my arch.  That night I bought decent insoles to help and they did.  However my right knee (same leg) was killing me.  I woke up on day 3 with a swollen knee.  I completed the walk day 3 with lots of stop and icing along with ibprofen.  My knee was very swollen and where I got scared was it was buckling a few times.  I have never experienced that (I am 28 and play tons of sports).  This freaked me out a lot.  \\n\\nI took off work yesterday to sort of recoup.  I woke up in pain with a swollen knee which I sort of knew was coming.  I kept it elevated all day, with icing it on and off all day while also taking anti-inflamatory drugs.  Steps were a big issue, I had to take each one at a time, not putting my forward body's weight on that knee.\\n\\nWoke up this morning (Tuesday- 2 days after the walk) with a slightly swollen knee and a decent amount of stiffness. I am okay with that at this point.  I dont have the crazy pain on every step I take which is also good.  However, I do occasionally have my knee buckle.\\n\\nEdit: Family friend had me wear a knee brace today and have been taking asprin instead of ibprofen.  Still have buckle every once and a while.\\n\\nMy question is, should I really be concerned? Is this just to be assumed from a lot of use in a short period of time? When is the time where a flag should go up and I should get an MRI? Could I seriously tear my minuscus WALKING?\\n\\nI have never had any major knee issue/injury/surgery.  This question has been asked several times by medic staff, so I figured would be needed here.\\n\\nTHANKS IN ADVANCE!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   It's possible that you caused some damage while playing sports and now with a heavy amount of activity caused aggravation of that injury. Its possible to cause a small tear in a meniscus and go years without any problems until a specific event causes extra aggravation. The swelling, stiffness, and inability to hold your weight is a good indication that there could be some ligamental damage. My suggestion would be to find a sports medicine physician, you can do this by contacting your insurance company or your family doctor, and go have a proper evaluation. A written description with joint injuries is very limiting, you need a doctor to perform a physical exam to tell you for sure. For now, avoid extensive physical activity and keep it iced. Ibuprofen or aspirin are also good to help with pain and inflammation. Let me know how things go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Knee injury* 22\\n* Male\\n* 177cm (5'10'')\\n* 67kg (148lbs)\\n* White/Caucasian\\n\\nBackground story:\\n\\nBeen playing football (soccer) at least once every week for about 4 years now. I've also been exercising at home for about a year and a half. The rest of my time isn't so sporty. I spend a lot of time in front of my computer and have been since I started IT studies 4 years ago. I just started working in WebDev a few months ago so these past few months I've been spending at least 7 hours a day in front of a computer and probably about 3-5 hours when I'm home.\\n\\nI've never had trouble with my knees before. My injury happened when I wanted to start getting back my stamina 2 weeks ago and went on a 5km jog. I barely ran 2 of them and I walked the rest. I also took a few rests in between my runs. In any case, when I took my 2.5km break I felt my calves being really sore. I ran lightly a little and then walked back the rest. I didn't feel anything in my knee.\\n\\nThe next day my left knee started to hurt. I could barely walk. My calves were sore but I've dealt with DOMS before so I wasn't worried about them. I took a break from next week's football and ended up not playing football or running for 11 days. My knee felt completely healed. Then I went out for an hour and a half of football and the pain came back. I played the whole match but it was really uncomfortable by the end of it. That was yesterday. Today my knee feels even worse than last time.\\n\\nMy pain can be described as:\\n\\nGeneral discomfort. There are very few random positions that I can put my leg in while sitting where I don't feel any discomfort or pain. Walking is impossible without limping. My knee hurts most when I move it (bend or straighten). I'm no doctor but I was looking at [this image](http://www.christuslivewell.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Knee-Anatomy.jpg) and I feel like the pain is probably in my patellar or quadriceps tendon. It's definitely not in any of the ligaments on the side but it may be my ACL or anything from inside my knee. I know I can definitely feel pain if I press upon a certain central position on top of my patella. There is no visible swelling whatsoever though. I can actually sometimes feel it squeak like an old door hinge..\\n\\nI have to walk 20 minutes to work and back every day, so this is really uncomfortable for me. Can someone please tell me what I should do or at least how long I should rest and how to know when my knee is fully healed?  I'm not too good with knee diagnoses but I'd say stop walking to work for at least a few weeks (rest it), ice it, put an ACE wrap on it and take some ibuprofen or other NSAID regularly for a few weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Went for a run and now my left knee is swollen and in pain?I can feel a dull ache if I'm not moving my left knee, but when I bend it or straighten it out, it hurts more. I can feel swelling below and around my left kneecap. \\n\\nThing is, when I bend my left leg so my ankle is going towards my buttocks, and then straighten it out again, I can hear a click, a clicking noise from my knee. \\n\\nWhat the hell happened? Was it because when I ran I ran too hard or used the wrong shoes?

I went to dance class and afterwards for a week, my right knee was swollen and had a dull ache. It was painful when I would walk up or down steps or walk down a hill. I was diagnosed with chondromalacia patella which is not dangerous but common in runners. My sports medicine doctor said that I have bone spurs, and also certain muscles in my legs are weak. So when I dance, because some of my leg muscles are weak , it's pulling on my knee cap causing swelling. I'm seeing a sports medicine doctor now because my knee has been swelling up again. I've been doing physical therapy as ordered by my doctor.\\n\\nTry making an appointment with a sports medicine doctor, who is an orthopedic doctor that specializes in exercise related injuries. He/she can really diagnose what's going on. It's hard to say without an xray, but if your knee is swollen and achy, you should definitely have it checked out. As for the clicking, my doctor said it's common if it doesn't hurt but mention that to the sports medicine doctor also.  Fell on my knee - looking for advice to reduce inflammation8 fays ago I tripped over a root walking through some trees and fell over a curb, onto asphalt, landing on my palm and my right knee.\\nMy wrist has healed alright, and my knee has also started to heal as well. I have noticed a few things still wrong with the knee injury, though.\\nWhenever my knee goes over my toes, and pressure gets put on it (pushing off with the top of my foot off of the floor, etc.) I feel a pain in my lower knee, below and slightly to the left of my knee cap. If I sit down and poke around that area with my thumb and some pressure I can find the ligament/tendon that is inflamed and hurting. \\n\\nI'm a pretty avid gym-goer and this injury hasn't affected my deadlifts or lunges, but if I have a little bit of the wrong stature during squats, I feel a pain in the area I described. I have to keep strict form, where my knees never go over my toes, and even then I feel a slight pressure in my knee.\\n\\nI would just like to get some advice on some PT exercises I could do? Perhaps some OTC anti-inflammatory drugs I could take? I've been wearing a compression sleeve on and off and it's taken away some of the inflammation but this lingering bit is bothersome.\\n\\nThank you ahead of time :)  Sounds like a ligamentous injury, just as you suspect. \\n\\nIbuprofen or naproxen are both good OTC NSAIDS you could use for a limited time, assuming you don't have any chronic medical conditions (e.g., kidney problems). Other than that I would just take it easy on your knees for a week or so. Skip a few leg days :). Instead of a calf compression sleeve try knee brace/compression instead. It will heal on its own, give it time. \\n\\nAny popping or locking sensations could be a red flag for something more serious, like a meniscus or ACL injury. I would expect you to be in a lot more pain though.   Knee swelling after surgery wont go down after surgeryThe other year, I tore my meniscus, ACL, MCL and my patella tendon all in my right knee. I underwent 2 surgeries to fix this. The first one being on the day of the incident, fixing my meniscus, MCL and patella tendon and the most recent about 6 months ago, where they replaced my ACL with an allograft. I recently finished going through rehab and I was assured the swelling would go down. The swelling has not gone done and is on the lateral side of my knee. The swelling is to an extent that limits some of my daily activities and can be hard to get my knee fully extended. I am at school now and it is hard to make out to my Doctor for a follow up. Is this something that will go away or this there any operation that could help this?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     You're always going to have some swelling in the knee, unfortunately, but it can take up to a year to reach maximum improvement postop. If it's limiting your activities though, would consider going to see a doc locally.

When did this happen? I'm guessing you went to the ER? ,Likely a meniscal injury. Go see an Orthopaedic surgeon. ,Not necessarily surgery. You'll need to be examined, but clicking/catching usually mean meniscus injury. May need an MRI, likely PT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           How can I diagnose chronic knee pain? Who should I see?I'm a 30 year old 170lb male, I played a lot of sports and was very active until about 24, then I got a full time sedentary job. I'm sitting 90% of my day. During my weekends I try to play rec sports, run, bike, etc, but my knees begin hurting immediately. My ankles hurt too, and eventually I will have tendonitis (I think) and my lower back can even hurt. I am pretty sure I had a slipped disc, but that's another story.\\n\\nI want to fix all of these problems but I don't know who to see. I have a family doctor but I'd rather go straight to the expert. Maybe this indicates an underlying issue, or maybe I just need to use my joints more often and apply some kind of therapy. I want to play some soccer this spring and summer but I dread having to sit after 15 minutes from excruciating joint pain :(                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Did you have any trauma to the knee? Hip? Back? At all? Is the pain constant? Or only after exercise? Have you tried using ice on the knees/ankles after exercise? Tried taking ibuprofen/Tylenol? ,My first thoughts would definitely be light exercise. Your joints probably hurt from inflammation now not an old injury. If you don't use it for a while the muscles with shrink and the joint will be less stable. Start with low impact exercise (biking / swimming) and build up your strength and tolerance. Then make sure to use ice and just slowly build to a steady routine. The \"quick fix\" you are asking for doesn't exist. It just doesn't. Even a complete joint replacement (please don't do that) won't 100% fix things. ,Happy to help. And just because it is a last resort and definitely a point of no return. I think the body (even when semi-broken) is still a pretty damn well put together machine. We have come a long way in joint replacements but still the body adapts to trauma relatively well and can usually compensate and make things work fine. So then replacing the joint is basically another major trauma to heal from, but with foreign things.                                                                                                 Knee numb after falling a few days ago.In my hurry I fell from my bicycle Friday morning. I had a few scratches, but the pain went away after a few hours. My right knee also has some scratches, but all exterior pain is gone. However, today my knee still feels weird. This concerns only the upper part of the knee.\\n\\nThere's no obvious bruising or anything. It doesn't hurt either. There's just a weird tingly sensation when I tap or touch it. Sitting, standing or laying for a while and changing positions (bending my knee) also gives strange tingly numbing sensations. Trying to fold that leg gives me a sense of uncomfortableness, which borders on pain, but it's not pain. Walking feels weird. Doing anything with that leg feels weird.\\n\\nAm I safe to walk, bicycle and move about normally?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      If you are worried about it, you should have it examined by a doctor for any signs of ligament damage.\\n\\nIf it happened 3-4 days ago, some of the unusual symptoms you are describing could be from inflammation or fluid accumulation from within the joint which will make it feel stiff and hard to move.\\n\\nActivity as tolerated if usually fine with most minor knee injuries, but it's impossible to give specific advice without having your knee examined by a professional,Sounds like \"fluid on the knee\" from the initial injury.  \\n\\nProbably nothing serious, try babying it for few days, get it checked out if it persists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               What is the procedure to mend a torn meniscus? (Answers for mild, moderate, and severe tears please)I'm running a race today on what I believe is a torn meniscus. I can run with no/little pain, but straightening my knee and bending it are difficult. As a secondary question, does that description sound like a torn meniscus?\\n18 y/o, Male, 5'11, 140 lbs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                That could be symptoms of a meniscal tear. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to first get your knee problems diagnosed before you ask about treatment strategies in mild, moderate and severe cases? \\n\\nSee your general practitioner or an orthopaedic surgeon.

              "4  Had a strange experience last night.Woke up in the middle of the night to take a leak. As I flushed the toilet I remember standing there feeling very light headed. I turned around and started to walk back to bed but never made it. Apparently I passed out. When I came to, my wife was pretty freaked out and I felt like crap but, i've been knocked out in the past and it felt similar. I hit my head on the sliding glass shower door and have a decent sized knot so I wonder if I had a concussion, the thought crossed my mind last night as well but I said screw it and went back to bed. This morning, while playing it back in my head I can't figure out what happened. I've never randomly passed out before, any thoughts??\\n\\nBackground: Male, mid 20's. 5'9. 165 lbs. 15%-ish body fat.

I think I just had a seizure?* Age:25\\n* Sex: F\\n* Height 5'4\\n* Weight 180\\n* Race Hispanic/Native American\\n* Duration of complaint 30 Seconds?\\n* Location (Geographic and on body): US, All over I guess\\n* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): Headaches, possibly cluster headaches but mostly chronic migraines.\\n* Current medications (if any): None\\n\\n\\nSo around 2PM today, I sat down and took a drink of water. I started choking and got the really bad pain when something doesnt go down right and my heart was hurting quite badly. My breathing was painful but I was still able to breathe regularly. After about 15 seconds of that, I fell backwards and my muscles completely stiffened. I blacked out and vaguely recall burning in my ears and fingertips. When I regained consciousness (maybe 30 seconds later), I felt disoriented and tired. Nothings happened since then and the feeling of being \"off\" has gradually faded eight hours later. \\n\\nI do have a history of extremely bad headaches but that's all I can think of that'd be relevant. This is the first time something like this has happened.\\n\\nPretty much just want to know if I should brave the emergency room on a Friday night or make an appointment later in the week.... or if it's even necessary. Thanks guys!\\n\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        So you started choking and fell to the floor and blacked out very briefly? That sounds more like a fainting episode than a seizure. You are generally *very* confused for quite a while after a seizure, and it can be accompanied by loss of control of your bladder/bowel, tongue biting etc. It's possible it could have been either but fainting (syncope) seems more consistent with following a choking fit. \\n\\nI'm not sure if the history of migraine is relevant, it could be. Was it actually diagnosed as migraine and how long have you been getting them? \\n\\nI'm thinking because it happened once after a clear precipitating event and seems to have resolved now I wouldn't bother going to the ED. I would try and make an appointment just so you can get a clearer idea of what happened and they can run a few checks like an examination, EKG etc. \\n\\nI'd go to the emergency department if it happened again, you had difficulty breathing or you became progressively more unwell. If that was the case I'd suggest you don't drive to hospital, get a lift or call an ambulance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Had a strange experience last night.Woke up in the middle of the night to take a leak. As I flushed the toilet I remember standing there feeling very light headed. I turned around and started to walk back to bed but never made it. Apparently I passed out. When I came to, my wife was pretty freaked out and I felt like crap but, i've been knocked out in the past and it felt similar. I hit my head on the sliding glass shower door and have a decent sized knot so I wonder if I had a concussion, the thought crossed my mind last night as well but I said screw it and went back to bed. This morning, while playing it back in my head I can't figure out what happened. I've never randomly passed out before, any thoughts??\\n\\nBackground: Male, mid 20's. 5'9. 165 lbs. 15%-ish body fat.

I think I just had a seizure. I'm not too sure please help or advise.About ten minutes ago, around five A.M. I was reading on my phone while laying in bed for an assignment due tomorrow. My room was very warm so I stood up to close the vent on my ceiling. The second I was on my feet my entire body started to convulse and for ten seconds I lost all motor control and fell to the floor. As my body just shook. Nothing like this has happened before and I'm pretty scared. Should I call 911 or am I fine and should get some sleep?\\n\\nI'm 20 Male\\n\\nI would like to point out two things differently than today. \\nFirst I have almost been awake for 24 hours. Some assignments have crept up on me faster than expected. \\nSecond I'm prescribed adderall 10 mg IR in the mornings and ten in the evenings. Since I have been awake for 24 hours working I have take a total of 30 mg during this time. \\nOther than a stiff neck from the shaking and the anxiety of what to do I feel fine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Go to the hospital. If its nothing its nothing, but it sounds like you indeed had a seizure. \\n\\nEdit: Sounds like it could be presyncope, which I don't know too much about. In either case it demands a prompt response.,I don't think this was a seizure because you did not lose consciousness, but i do think you should go see a doctor anyway,This                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Sudden Blackout(Seizure)A few minutes ago I stood up having been sitting down for quite a while.  \\nAs happens quite regularly on doing this I had a few seconds of dizzyness.  \\nThis time, however it did not wear off momentarily.  \\n  \\nI went into an almost dreamlike state and woke a minute or two later leaning against a chair with my entire body feeling like I was shaking.  \\n  \\nI have no history of anything like this.  \\nI am: 18, male, from the UK, around 6ft and 10 stone .  \\nI am not on medication or anything like that.  \\nThe only thing out of the ordinary is that earlier today I had my blood taken for the first time in my life.\\nIs this something serious, it is currently scaring the living shit out of me.  \\nAny ideas?  \\nIf you want any more info please ask.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Naturally, over the internet I can't provide any type of definitive diagnosis, but\\n\\n&gt;I stood up having been sitting down for quite a while. As happens quite regularly on doing this I had a few seconds of dizzyness.\\n\\nsounds quite classically like [orthostatic hypotension](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostatic_hypotension), which if it is happening regularly appears to be a longstanding issue for you.\\n\\nAs described in the article, all of the symptoms you experienced today can also be attributed to OH, including your \"dreamlike state\". Though it is possible, I doubt you actually experienced a seizure. While the amount of blood drawn for typical studies is not enough to drop your blood pressure significantly, if you have a history of dizzyness on standing and maybe were dehydrated (did you fast for the blood test?) it might have exacerbated enough to cause a more significant reaction.\\n\\nIt's most likely nothing to worry about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Numbness and pins and needles in fingersIf it helps I'm 18, female, 84 pounds, and 5.4 feet tall.\\n\\nBoth of my hands started going numb around 6 PM (Eastern) yesterday, and then, when I touched an object the fingertips began to sting and tingle. The skin on them also started to get reddish. I put some Nivea lotion on them to soothe the redness, and thankfully it went away in a couple of hours. I woke up around an hour ago and realized I could handle things with my right hand again without stinging, but my left hand still feels numb, especially on my index finger which has a small paper cut near the tip.\\n\\nI'm not too worried about this and it's not bothering me too much, but a diagnosis would be helpful in getting rid of it.\\n\\nThanks in advance.\\n\\n

                              loud sound in my head at various timesso this has been happening to me quite frequently and I have no idea what's wrong with me. it never used to happen but a while ago, I don't remember how long, I started getting  loud noises in my head whenever I try to sleep, I'm about to fall asleep, or when I simply lay down and close my eyes. it sounds like an old camera flash like \"PPPHHHOOOOSH\" and sometimes its accompanied by a flash in my eyes (closed), and when it happens right as I'm about to fall asleep it makes me jerk awake. \\nanyone know what this could possibly be? is it dangerous?\\nI know it scares the hell out of me sometimes.

Sounds like exploding head syndrome. Probably a variant of the feeling that you're falling right before you fall asleep (hypnic jerk).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I've been passing out frequently? whats the difference between passing out or a seizure?Since february I have passed out 4 times, which seems like a lot but maybe it's normal, i don't know. The first time I was in ceramics class and I was listening to a critique and then next thing I know everyone is looking at me and asking if I'm ok and I'm on the ground and I don't remember a thing. I felt fine after. The next two times I was alone at my house so I have no idea what happened, I just remember working on dinner and then I'm on the ground, felt like it was only a second. \\n\\nThe most recent time however was kind of different and this was yesterday. I was with 3 of my friends at their house we were just hanging out and I start getting my stuff together because i had to meet up with my boyfriend, and then (I don't remember a lot) but my friend was holding my arms trying to keep me balanced and I was totally out of it. Then I was on the ground so I tried to get up and she helped me stand up and I went to go down the stairs and I totally lost consciousness again and fell down the stairs pretty hard (apparently, like I said I don't remember really any of this) and then they helped me up again and I don't know what happened but I remember seeing really bright light and I was outside and I guess I fell down again and then got up, passed out again, and they carried me to the front steps and I was able to kind of \"wake up\" at that point and I was feeling super weird the rest of the day, but I think that was just cause I hit my head really hard. I also pissed myself. And the whole process from the first time I passed out to when I was able to get myself awake and had control of my body was about 10-15 minutes. I don't remember much at all, most is totally black and I have some fuzzy memories of parts of it. \\n\\nI don't have any cardiovascular issues that I am aware of, and I drink plenty of water, am active and eat well, over all a healthy person. I'm a 19 year old female, 5'8\" and 140lbs. and I have a medical history of asthma when I was a kid, but no other physical medical history really. What could be the cause? should I be concerned? Any insight would be helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            So there doesn't seem to be anything that makes you lose consciousness? Heat, stress, standing up for long periods, pain? I understand you don't feel like you're going to pass out? Dizzy, visual problems, sweating? Any palpitations? Did you lose you bladder control any of the other times? \\n\\nDo you make any movements or sounds when you were passed out according to the witnesses? If you wake up, do you know where you are or are you confused for some time? Any family history of epilepsy? Have you noticed any muscle twitching, especially just after you woke up?\\n\\nBased on your story, there are some things not typical for just 'fainting', I would suggest you discuss this with your PCP.\\n\\nIn general: 'passing out' is used to describe a vasovagal collaps: a reflex, triggered by something like pain or emotion where the blood pressure drops and people faint. Usually preceded by lightheadedness, dizziness, sweating and the like. Usually benign (although people can injure themselves when falling). Seizures are the result of epileptic activity in the brain; which can be part of an epileptic syndrome, caused by an underlying other brain disease. Sometimes, otherwise healthy people can have epileptic seizures in certain circumstances. A febrile seizure in infants for example, or a seizure because of sleep deprivation or substance abuse.,If you mean with immediately: contact your PCP for an appointment as soon as possible, sure. Rushing to the ER with the complaint of loss of consciousness yesterday doesn't seem like the most efficient approach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    My heart rate is through the roofToday I took a BMI test, and scored a little under 23. Just to get the info that may be needed aside, here's what you need to know about me:\\n\\nI'm a male, I'm 5'6 and about 140 pounds, I am white, I take no medication,and  cancer runs in my family (I don't know if that's relevant).\\n\\nMy stationary heart rate is about 130 at times. This really scares me, especially since I have problems standing up. I get head rushes so bad I pass out maybe 70-80% of the time I stand up, no matter how slowly I do. I don't know what else you'd need to know about me. Any help, doc?                                                       &gt; I pass out maybe 70-80% of the time I stand up\\n\\nYou pass out? To me..passing out means you fainted - you lost consciousness briefly and fell to the floor. Does it mean something else to you? ,..What age are you?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Hit my head, need some adviceI hit my head at a concert last night pretty hard, someone headbutted or elbowed me, i don't know.  I didn't black out or anything, no nausea.  I was drunk when it happened, and I still kept going after that.  (It was a metal concert so a lot of screaming, headbanging, and great things to do after you hit your head really hard.  I went home, went to bed, had a terrible dream,(unrelated), and woke up a couple times during the night feeling disoriented.  Woke up this morning, have a consistent headache and I guess dizziness and felt slow to respond to things, it's hard to describe.  It could just be my sinuses too, its very dry out right now.  I can't really tell if it's a hangover or if it's possibly a concussion.  Either way, is it important I get it checked out?  I feel a doctor would just tell me to rest regardless and it would just be a waste of money.  \\n\\nMale\\n22 \\nCaucasian\\n5'7\\n180lbs\\nno meds or med issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  It sounds like a possible concussion.\\n\\nHard to rule out more serious things like bleeding in the brain, though very rare, without having a doctor do a neurologic exam.

            "`QUESTION: Please help me.[deleted] `ANSWER: Get checked for herpes yourself. Have you or your girlfriend ever had herpes on the lips (also known as cold sores)? The same virus can be transferred to the genitals (with fingers or directly), causing new symptoms there. `QUESTION: So my sister had this on her neck, we think it might be a bite or somethingage: 4approximate height: I think about 3 feetweight about 30gender Fmedications you take: none smoking status: Nope previous and current medical issues: none duration and location of complaint: neck, noticed todayhttp://imgur.com/VEACGHT `ANSWER: Could be a bite. It also looks a bit like a burn. If it's not bothering her, just leave it alone, maybe cover it with some vaseline or something. If it spreads or gets bigger or she develops more, it might be worth an appointment with her primary care physician.  `QUESTION: Do I have testicular cancer?!Hey, I am really scared that I have testicular cancer. I noticed a lump that just formed this past 3 hours on my scrotum infront of my right testicle. It's more like swelling skin and if have had this happen before because of hives that got to my scrotum. My scrotum was normal yesterday and this morning, but I am getting scared to think I have testicular cancer. I did have a fever today and so I took some Advil and Ibuprofen. Is the swelling an effect of that or do I have testicular cancer? I am 16 and I am really scared `ANSWER: I understand you have a swelling on your scrotal skin which formed in 3 hours? That's not testicular cancer, but I can't examine you over the internet. Visit a doctor.,No, if it goes away, you shouldn't be worried. But as you state that you are really scared, the reassurance of an actual doctor is probably better than the reassurance of one over the internet. You don't have to visit a doctor right now, just make an appointment to see one sometime in the next couple of days if the swelling persists. `QUESTION: I found a lump.It's difficult to gauge its size, because it has no protruding/defined shape and mostly just feels like a hard spot about the size of a pea on my pubis near the base of my scrotum.I can rule out STD's, because I'm a virgin and its been a couple days that it hasn't varied in size and/or shown particular signs of irritation, so I'm assuming it's just a clogged pore or ingrown hair.Thoughts? It's not swollen enough for me to consider lancing it, so what can I do about it?  `ANSWER: Really impossible to say. A more full history is needed, but really a physical exam is needed as well. We spend quite a bit of time learning what normal and abnormal things look and feel like and how to describe that to each other so we know what we are talking about. Without that training it would be very difficult to try and get a solid answer over the internets. if it isn't red, swollen, painful, and you don't have fevers, shakes, chills, sweats, etc then it certainly isn't an emergency. The most sinister thing to consider would be cancer, but that is pretty low on the differential given what you said. If it gets red, swollen, painful, etc go have it checked out. If it is an ingrown hair or small site of infection it will most likely clear on its own, but it could become an abscess and require incision and drainage. Don't wait too long to be seen after symptoms appear (really, you should be seen within 24 hours of any symptoms) because the infection could spread rapidly and cause huge problems. If it stays the same or goes away, then it is most likely not something to worry about. If it changes - gets larger, lumpier, more irregular, changes color, or you see more of them popping up... go see a doctor. ,No worries. Just playing the odds it is probably nothing. Just keep an eye on it and make sure things don't go awry. `QUESTION: Severe head pain with swollen lump on back of the head in elderly woman.Hello, I'm asking this for my 69 year old grandmother. 4 foot 10, maybe 125lbs.She's had these headaches, 4 over the past 3 weeks or so. The pain starts at the back of her head on the left hand side and shoot to the front and she said the pain is debilitating and horrific for about a minute, then it subsides. Yesterday, she discovered a quarter sized bump on the back of her head (low on the left side). It's tender to touch and moderately hard. Any ideas what might be going on? Thanks in advance. `ANSWER: Shingles.  Does she feel her hair/scalp tingling?,Shingles,Call doc, describe symptoms, see if they will call in Valtrex and schedule a visit (in that order).  Since doesn't sound classic they will likely say they want to see her first.,Needs someone to take a look. Could be infected sebaceous cyst, infected hair follicle.  `QUESTION: So i gave a girl oral. Couple days later she tells me shes been having vaginal pain for awhile. Then these bumps appear on my tongue and it starts to feel raw and sensitive. Help?http://m.imgur.com/4i3DJeg `ANSWER: Time to go to an STD clinic!  Go TODAY./u/naught could be right, it could be thrush, but it also could be chlamydia.  And if it's chlamydia, you also need to be tested for gonorrhea, since they hang out together.Ask her if she's been tested for STDs.  If she hasn't been tested, she needs to go with you.  Some STDs in women can lead to infertility.Time to be responsible adults.  Go get tested!,Yup, time to get checked for STDs including herpes. `QUESTION: Left breast pain and itchy nipple26Female115lbs5\"2Duration: 1 monthCurrent medication: noneMedical issues: polycystic ovaries, IBSI came off the birth control pill about 6 months ago. I was on the pill for 10 years and I decided to come off as I'm not having sex with anyone at the moment. My left nipple has been incredibly itchy the last month and I get shooting pains on the left side of my chest sometimes. It's not always itchy and it comes and goes. I haven't changed detergent/deodorant recently and I'm sure I'm not pregnant. It's only ever the left nippleThe nipple itself looks normal `ANSWER: It would be with seeing a doctor about this. Do you have an OB? It could be something as simple as an infection but that is rather odd. Is it tender to the touch? Does it feel like it's swollen around/near the area? You have not had any fevers/chills correct? ,OB is an obstetrician. OB/gyn is your typical female doctor. First thing they would do is evaluate it, possible ultrasound, also some basic labs too. And possibly offer treatment options `QUESTION: Should I see a doc about this on my penis? I've only been having sex with the same girl for a few months and never had anything like this before. I think it might just be an abrasion, but its getting bigger and not really healing.http://imgur.com/qzGXhKA `ANSWER: imgur,com and it will give you a link. But the answer is probably yes you should see a doctor. ,That needs to go get checked out. Have you/her been tested for STI/STD beforehand?,Probably because it's an embarrassing thing for many people to ask their real doctor. ,What about the other person? It looks suspiciously like a Syphilis chancre. ,No one knows what it is until you get tested or seen by a physician. If it is syphilis, it can be treated. If you have a planned parenthood in your area, they are quick and cheap and provide great care. `QUESTION: Bump on left thigh next to groinToday I discovered a bump on my thigh that is fairly close to my groin. Never had this before. 19 m 155 pounds. Bump hurts at the touch. All I wanna know is should I be worried? Should I see a MD? `ANSWER: Please fill out the required information in the sidebar.This could be an inguinal lymph node. Sexual history? Unprotected sex? Penile discharge? Ulcers on the penis? ,Might be a little skin infection or a follicle somewhere then. Watch and wait I'd say, wouldn't be too worried. If it persists after a few days, increases in size, becomes red or you get multiple lumps, see a doc.,Probably an inflammed follicle. `QUESTION: Trying to get y friend to see a doctor but she wants to wait and see what happens. I'm worried sick and would like to know hat she might haveMy friend found a dime sized red lump a bit to the right of her clitoris in the shower this morning. its swollen to about 1.5cm. A little sensitive, but it doesnt hurt. The redness is isolated to the lump. I'd really like to know if it is urgent she seeks help so I can tell her so. All of what i describe is what she told me and I cant verify how accurate it is, but shes worried and im worried for her. `ANSWER: This is most likely a Bartholin's Gland Cyst. On either side of the labia majora is a called a Bartholin's gland. Occasionally the ducts that empty the gland can become blocked causing the gland to develop a cyst. Sometimes they can go away on their own, and other times they can become infected and need to be drained by a doctor. Based on the description you gave, redness around the area it may be infected. Its nothing life threatening, but you should tell your friend to go see an OBGYN to get an examination and antibiotics.  `QUESTION: Trying to get y friend to see a doctor but she wants to wait and see what happens.

            "`QUESTION: My dad has mystery brain swelling and memory loss - can any doctors provide input on what to look for next?About 3 years ago, my dad began showing signs of memory and cognitive loss. It started small - he'd misplace belongings or seem unable to follow conversations, for example. Eventually he couldn't find his way home from the neighborhood store and has declined since.Now, at only 62 years old, he is unable to dress himself, handle personal hygiene, or hold a conversation that makes sense. All signs pointed to early onset dementia or Alzheimer's, so we took him to neurologists at UCLA where they instead discovered he has encephalopathy (brain inflammation). Blood tests have also shown he is producing a mysterious antibody called anti-recoverin, which have led doctors to believe an auto-immune reaction is causing the brain inflammation which is causing symptoms of dementia.My dad has been tested for common auto-immune disorders like lupus and Celiac's disease, but nothing has been found. The antibody anti-recoverin is usually associated with cancer of the retina, but no cancer has been found and his eyes are healthy. We attempted to treat my dads brain swelling with steroids and IVIG treatment at UCLA but he showed no response. The inflammation hasn't changed in at least 1.5 years. In that time we've been desperate to improve the inflammation so we've taken him to psychologists, psychiatrists, neurologists, general practitioners, holistic doctors, herbalists, and more throughout Southern California. We've tried every treatment that has been recommended and my dad has shown zero response to any of it. After countless MRI's, PET scans, SPECT brain imaging, X-rays, blood tests, testing for food allergies, and toxicities, we still have no clue what could be causing the inflammation. We've tried treating his symptoms with medications for memory loss (given to patients with dementia), depression, anxiety (of which he's had both for years), natural supplements, vitamins, oils, IV vitamin and mineral therapy, nutrition and diet changes (gluten and dairy free), and hyperbaric oxygen treatment, but there has been no change.The reason I'm on Reddit is because my family is at a standstill. Caring for my dad 24/7 and taking him to so many doctors has become extremely taxing on us all, including him. But we don't just want to give up. It's possible he could have SOME improvement if we just find the cause of the brain swelling. My concern is that we're looking for the wrong things. I wonder if he has a bacteria or virus that is manifesting in brain swelling when it rarely does that, so we're missing it.If there are any doctors or friends of doctors out there reading who may have a idea or recommendation that I haven't mentioned above, I'd really appreciate hearing from you. If anyone knows a Dr. House or brilliant diagnostician with experience in mysterious brain reactions, I'd really appreciate hearing from you. Thank you all. OTHER things that may be worth mentioning: -We recently discovered a lot of black mold in my parents' kitchen. But everyone else seems to be totally healthy.-My dad had a severe speech impediment for which he was brutally bullied until he was 16, and due to his tough childhood he's always been a highly anxious adult.-He has had chronic stomach issues since childhood (mainly low appetite, pain, and constipation) which we often attributed to his anxiety, but since eliminating gluten and dairy from his diet he seems to have improved a lot on this front-My dad became extremely depressed in 2005 after a loss in the family and never quite recovered emotionally-My dad lost about 30 pounds over the past 6 years, which we attributed at the time to depression. He's always been thin (6' and 150lb average) but now he is 6' and 120lb and cannot gain weight. `ANSWER: Has plasmapheresis been tried as a treatment? If you've tried everything else it may be worth a shot. I've seen some patients with paraneoplastic syndromes who have received benefit from it but others who have not.On that note, you say your father has tested positive for anti-recoverin. I'm assuming that he was tested for a variety of paraneoplastic antibodies, like the ones in [this panel](http://www.mayomedicallaboratories.com/test-catalog/Overview/83380). Is that the case?Check out [this website](https://aealliance.org/) and see if it sounds similar to what the doctors you've seen are telling you. I can't give you a diagnosis and I don't know what all has been investigated in your father's case, but you may be able to find some information here to discuss with your father's doctor. `QUESTION: Elevated CBC results along with elevated blood albumin.

In the urine test, he found 1+ protein along with trace amounts of albumin and bilirubin. He thought I was dehydrated, but wanted to wait for the blood test. My blood pressure was slightly elevated (130 over 80) and heart rate was 110 (I'm fairly scared of the doctor's office). All kidney results came in normal, but parts of my RBC and albumin were elevated:Albumin - 5.4 High (3.6-5.1)Albumin/Globulin Ratio - 2.6 High (1.0-2.5)Red Blood Cell Count 5.88 High (4.2-5.8)Hemoglobin - 17.2 High (13.2-17.1)Hematocrit - 52.2 High (38.5-50)The thing is my air conditioner has been broken, and it's summer in a very hot, humid state. I didn't know if I could drink water before the test, so I sort of sat around in my house sweating while waiting for the air conditioner people to arrive. Even when it came time to give a urine sample, I had to ask to drink some water and even then could barely get much out (it was a pretty pronounced yellow/orange). That means the time I had my last drink of water was around 9 or 10 the previous day, and I had my blood drawn at noon the next. Anyway, their office called me wanting me to see a hematologist. Worried, I showed the results to a friend with a medical background. Looking at it, he said that it looked like dehydration. When I looked it up online myself, too, elevated blood albumin is almost always related to dehydration, and dehydration would also cause these results to read a little high. I just had my CBC taken about 8 months ago, and it came back perfectly fine. My friend suggested I retake the CBC alone in a few weeks after my air conditioner is fixed and when I've made sure to stay hydrated. Then, if they still come back as off, go see the hematologist. Is the elevation really that extreme, or is it quite innocuous?Note: I do have a mitral valve prolapse, but when I got my check-up with my cardiologist last year, he said it hadn't changed in the past 7 years. What are your thoughts?  `ANSWER: Do you smoke?Do you live at altitude?If you just showed me the results, I would agree with your friend.  They are not markedly off normal to say \"oh yeah badness going on here\".  I agree repeating it with some better hydration opportunity may be the better course of valor.If your doc is referring for some other reason that we are not seeing here, then I would say you need to communicate that with the doctor so you have an understanding.  Oftentimes when you go the hematologist, they will ask \"so why are you here?\" and you need be able to verbalize that clearly.  You shouldn't *have* to do this, but unfortunately this is how it sometimes goes.,Ok.  Im sticking with my answer.  I would negotiate a recheck under better conditions.  If I was a hematologist, thats the first test I would order, a repeat after a period of time.  If its 'bad' it tends to worsen with time.  If its 'fine' then it tends to get better over time. `QUESTION: Can a doctor explain to me what an abnormal blood clotting time could mean?I take no meds except for a multi vitamin. I had blood labs done and my doc said that my blood clotting times were \"slow\", as if I was on blood thinners, which I am not. Also said Vit D levels were low which is weird because I just spent a week on vacation on the beach. She really wants me to see a hematologist and got me a referral for one. They have since taken even more blood labs and haven't told me anything except just to make the appointment with the hematologist and then follow up with her after. should I be worried? What could I possibly have to see a specialist for? `ANSWER: You could have a genetic defect that prevents your blood from clotting normally. You could either clot too fast or not clot fast enough.You're probably getting more tests for hemophilla which occurs mostly in men.It would be good to ask all old people in your family if they remember anyone with a blood clotting problem..... grandma's brothers, mom's brother's and such.Also you need a repeat test to make sure it wasn't a lab error.Yes you need a hematologist. http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemophilia/basics/definition/con-20029824,Why did your doctor order clotting tests? `QUESTION: I have severe crohn's and my boyfriend wants me to stop taking immune suppressants. Is this possible?Let me start by apologizing for the wall of texts. Also, this isn't just about medicine. Medicine is clearly involved, but my relationship is also factoring in. I apologize for that too.  I am 29, white female, 5'5, 110-150lbs (depending on health), I was diagnosed with severe crohn's disease 12 years ago. No surgeries related to crohns. My worst flare was about three years ago. I had four hospitalizations in one year and it took another year and a half of recovering and coming off of prednisone and pain killers. I have been on remicade, humira, imuran, and cimzia. I am now taking 100mg of imuran every day and 400 mg of cimzia every three weeks. I also take calcium, vitamin D, and medical cannabis. I only take pain medications when I flare up and refuse to take them for anything else. Started seeing a guy about a month ago. He's an emt and a massage therapist. He has studied a lot of natural medicines and hates pharmicutical companies. I actually really like him, except he is pushing me very hard to stop the immune suppressants. I don't care for his arrogance on this topic, but I do think he is right about the immune suppressants harming me in the long run.I get sick all the time and it takes a very long time to get better. I have bone loss from the prednisone and my heart rate stays around 100. Doctors have said that even though I seem to be doing well right now, I will never be in remission. My latest blood test showed my MCV levels to be slightly elevated, but I'm not sure what that really means yet. Boyfriend just says it's very bad and scares me about it. The crohn's and colitis foundation has an article on their website about treating crohns through diet and microbiome therapy (website: http://www.ccfa.org/research/current-research-studies/microbiome-video.html). There is no reference to taking immune suppressants with this form of treatment. However, since reading this I started taking boswellia and all-zyme pills given to me by my boyfriend.I am interested in finding a healthier diet for myself and am researching options. I have really only known clear liquid diets and building up what I can eat again for the last 12 years. Definitely do not have the healthiest diet because of it. In two week I have my next appointment with my gastro doc. I would like to bring up this study and ask her if it would be possible to start this other type of treatment and only use the immune suppressants like I use pain killers (during flares and to control a flare).  While I am serious about making changes, my boyfriend pushing me to stop the immune suppressants quickly. We had a major fight about it yesterday. I am stressing out over this. I guess I don't know if I need medical advice or a counselor. I don't think I can make it another two weeks of being pushed like this. Please help somebody. `ANSWER: I'm sorry I can't help you with the pharmaceutical part but you should know that MCV, mean corpuscular volume, is just a measure of the average size of your red blood cells. Typically over 100 is considered abnormal. Assuming you are also anemic (low hematocrit or hemoglobin) there are several causes of what we call macrocytic (large cell) anemia- given your dietary and GI issues the most likely of which is vitamin B12 deficiency. But the tl:dr is that a slightly elevated MCV is not only not \"very bad\", it's not even necessarily clinically significant.With that out of the way, I will say this is my personal and not professional opinion but your boyfriend sounds like kind of a jerk. You have absolute autonomy over your own body and what you put in it and you have the right to take medicine. Crohns is not a mild annoyance, it's a serious autoimmine disorder and if your boyfriend can't take that seriously (not to mention misunderstanding basic hematology) you should not be trusting him for medical advice.,Frankly, your boyfriend: (1) isn't qualified to make the sort of decisions he's making about your health, (2) isn't very knowledgeable, and (3) has no right to push you so forcefully regarding YOUR medical care.Inflammatory bowel disease is a tricky one and everything is dependent on the severity of disease. You are fortunate to not have had any surgeries, but you say you have had multiple hospitalizations. Microbiome therapy is still in its infancy and the video you linked is currently in the research phase, not in clinical use.Feel free to talk to your doctor at your appointment about dietary options and other things you can try, and possibly tapering your immunosuppressants. You may be able to develop a plan with her that you feel suits you better. The key is to make sure you are well informed about the risks of stopping your current therapy, finding out whether your medicine can be ceased at once or must be stopped gradually if that is your intention, and keeping up monitoring to track disease status and progression.Do not be bullied into making a premature decision without knowing the risks and consequences by someone with little to no medical training. You know much better than he that Crohn's is a serious condition.And for the record, without knowing the actual numeric value I don't know exactly what you mean by \"slightly elevated\" MCV, but it's highly unlikely that it is \"very bad\". Slightly elevated MCV rarely means anything to most people.,Hopefully you ARE trusting your gastroenterologist.As far as MCV, the way we calculate reference ranges means that statistically sometimes healthy people will have values that flag as abnormal. I'm always especially suspicious of this when the value is only minutely elevated. That said,  you are not a healthy person. B complex vitamin deficiencies aren't super common because they tend to be plentiful in the diet, but your GI issues are probably negatively impacting your gut's ability to absorb the vitamins. Probably the best move from here, and this is likely what your doc will suggest, is to just repeat the CBC. If it's still high, a vitamin b12 test can confirm the cause. Vitamin B12 shits can reverse the anemia quite effectively. `QUESTION: 19 F, random green bruises on legs?I'm 5'2\" and about 105 lbs, white, and this has been going on for a couple weeks. I'm pretty pale but the skin inside of my eyelids is red and I have color everywhere else, but I have dark undereye circles that have been there since childhood(probably from allergies). Now, I am a dancer so I tend to throw my body all over the place on a hard floor, so I am used to seeing bruises on  y shins and knees, but I've been getting small green bruises on places like my outer thigh, inner thigh, calf, and hamstring and I'm getting concerned. I don't have night sweats or feel fatigued, but my gums do bleed a little when I brush and I have a little blood in the tissue when I blow my nose after I wake up. My periods are painful and *kind of* heavy. I have some shin pain but that is probably from dancing. I'm a bit of a space cadet mentally sometimes. I haven't been eating much red meat or meat in general other than some chicken or fish lately, is it possible that I'm just anemic? should I eat more red meat to see if that helps? Is it just from rigorous exercise? `ANSWER: Please go get a basic blood test.  I say this as a doc because you could have low platelets caused by a number of things.  I hope you follow through on this.  It's probably not anything that is fixable on your own if you are having the problems that you say you are and they are extensive.  Don't message me back.  Go get checked out.,Family doc here, agree completely with barmal.  You need to get your blood cells and platelets checked to proceed any further.The likelihood of leukemia is still low, but catastrophic processes have to be ruled out first.It's much more likely to be a benign condition like idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura that might not need treatment but needs to be assessed and followed.Anemia itself isn't really a medical diagnosis, it's more of a test result showing low red blood cells.  There are lots of types of anemia, and if it is found, you need to see a doctor to try to determine the cause.  And most routine causes of anemia shouldn't make you bruise.,I just didn't want you thinking that was a replacement for an appt.  You are on the right track with anemia.  Take care!,Could be from dancing but no way to prove it.  A simple blood test will rule out a whole bunch of horrible diseases.   `QUESTION: Is this Leukemia / AML? Please Help.

We went to the doctor this morning, and she's referred him for a colonoscopy because his haemaglobin has dropped to 90 from 125. He absolutely refuses to go. He said all the right things to the doctor, but when we left he told me he's absolutely not going. His reasoning is that it's checking for cancer, which he won't treat anyway, or polyps, which he won't treat because he refuses to have another operation.Now, I totally understand his reasoning*, but I'm treading a fine line and I basically need to pick my battles. So I'm wondering if there's something else the procedure would show that would be treated without surgery or chemotherapy?52M&gt;160cm150kgCaucasianUnsure - no blood in faeces but test previous to this was 3-4 months ago, so the drop has been since thenExisting medical issues - you sure you got time for this?

He's been in chronic pain for 40 years, and I've had to become his carer because he lets his cellulitis flare so badly that he goes into septic shock because he simply doesn't want to live in pain anymore. If fixing the haemaglobin issue means taking a couple more pills, he'll do it; but if it's anything invasive, there's really no way he's gonna do it because there's literally zero benefit to him at this point. `ANSWER: Well, the simple answer would be that a GI doctor would be performing the colonscopy looking for causes of bleeding in the lower intestinal tract.  The two main things that could be causing this in your father's case would be colorectal cancer or polyps with that dramatic drop in hemoglobin or bleeding from his Aspirin therapy for prevention after this stroke (although Aspirin is more likely to make you bleed from your upper GI tract and stomach).Other things that don't require surgery or chemotherapy that could be treated with medications or theoretically being causing blood loss anemia and could be identified by a colonoscopy would be [diverticulitis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diverticulitis), [ulcerative colitis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitis), [angiodysplasia] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiodysplasia), [collagenous colitis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagenous_colitis).There are probably others.  Cancer and polyps are the main reason, but there are still lots of useful things that can be found and treated on colonoscopy, especially in a relatively young man like your father. `QUESTION: The doctor says it's probably normal for me, but on the Internet im hearing a different story.[deleted] `ANSWER: You're not in any age/race group that is likely to get any sort of bleeding disorder or leukemia. Your CBC is also pretty normal in every other value and you have no other symptoms. No easy bruising or bleeding from your nose. So yeah, your doctor is being pretty responsible, it looks like it's normal for you but it's best to run a few more tests. He'll probably order some platelet function tests and a peripheral blood smear. (Also don't listen to everything on the internet, like your doctor said, it could be normal for you, your body adapted to producing low platelets.) `QUESTION: My brother (35/M) is in the hospital with ITP. He is on his third transfusion and second round of immunoglobulin with no difference in his platelet count. Advice?Hi everyone,I am writing with concerns about my brother's condition. My brother had the flu and then a sinus infection back to back. He was on tami flu and then clarithromycin. And he was also taking aspirin and ibu profen for migraines.Wednesday he woke up with what he thought was a rash. Then, when he went to brush his teeth, his gums wouldn't stop bleeding. He went to the hospital and his platelets were &lt;7000. (Not sure exact number because once they go under 7000, they just say &lt;7000) he was given a transfusion. The rest of his CBC came back normal (WBC a slightly elevated, but was told steroids could do this) and his vitals are perfectly fine. He was also given steroids. He had a nose bleed as well from blowing his nose. Thursday morning, the blood test revealed no change in his platelet count. He was given a sonogram of his abdomen and it came back normal. He was given a second transfusion, steroids, Benadryl and immunoglobulin.He woke up today again with no change in his platelets. He is about to have his third transfusion. After that, he is going to have a second round of immunoglobulin. The doctor seems to think it could be a crazy virus causing all of this. We all felt a sinking feeling when we heard his blood platelets haven't changed since after the transfusions two days in a row. I was hoping there are possibly some doctors on here or patients who have dealt with similar cases who can offer some insight and potentially other things to bring up with the dr. Thank you everyone!Edit: Saturday morning still showed no signs of platelet increase. The Dr. doesn't expect his platelets to be up tomorrow because she thinks they would have already risen with this medicine if it was going to work for him. The next step is they are going to give him Rituximab starting monday, as well as transfusion and they are going to start tapering off slowly on steroids. The hematologist is going on vacation next week and Dr Vijay Shah is the hematologist that will be covering her. They cancelled a chest CT scan because they are afraid that he will sustain an injury in the process of being moved. 2nd Edit: I figured I would update you guys on the latest. My brothers platelets did not go up over the weekend dispute 3 days of immunoglobulin and transfusions and steroids. However, on Monday they went up to 18,000 and then 37,000 on Tuesday. A CT scan showed an enlarged spleen and swollen lymph nodes throughout. On Wednesday, he woke up with blood in his mouth and his count was back down to 17,000. Thursday it was 17,000 again. Yesterday, he was given a bone marrow biopsy. Took 5 times until they could get some marrow. So that was unpleasant. He also got a bunch of bloodwork done to rule out all types of infectious diseases. His hematologist ended up speaking with a dr at a bigger hospital and he was transferred last night. We are happy with the new hospital. They seem to be working fast. Just waiting on test results.  `ANSWER: stumped; I hope a Heme-onc or intensivist reads this board who can help you.,RemindMe! 1 week \"ITP case\",Not uncommon. Platelets would not be expected to make the platelet count go up, they just get eaten up the same way his native platelets are. We try not to give platelets to people with ITP unless they are bleeding and have severely low counts (and it sounds like your brother met both of those). His counts haven't recovered yet despite treatment, and that's obviously not what we want, but I don't know if he is refractory to treatment just yet, sometimes it takes a little longer. There are also additional therapies that can be tried, but the options may depend on what kind of hospital you are at.,I've been a little busy. How are things going if you don't mind me asking?,Good to hear. Sounds like there's a good plan in place. `QUESTION: Ease my worries pleaseMy husband is about to see a hematologist and googling around has me worried that he's got something serious, like aplastic anemia. I know we'll find out soon enough, but in the meantime, could you please suggest alternative diagnoses that aren't so scary, so I can think positively? He is 50 years old, fit as an ox (bike commutes daily), eats healthy, has taken a multivitamin and a baby aspirin daily for decades, is on no other meds, and is in otherwise excellent health -- except for chronic, unexplained anemia. He has had the anemia for at least a decade.  About 5 years ago, his GP sent him for endoscopy to rule out internal bleeding. Then she put him on a course of B12 injections, that did nothing. However a few months later, his anemia then improved enough that there was no further follow up and he was okay. This year he went back for a routine check up and his anemia is back, and worse than ever. He had another endoscopy and a colonscopy. His GI tract is normal, no gluten intolerance, nothing. His B12 and folate is also normal, and his GP no longer thinks it's related to diet/B12 deficiency. She has referred him to a hematologist. She has run a ton of blood tests, everything is normal, except for his hemoglobin, which is below normal. She is also concerned with his low total blood count. His WBC and platelets are within normal range - but at the very end of low. Symptoms - he has all the symptoms of anemia you'd expect. Extreme fatigue, weakness, dizziness, fainting spells, sometimes short of breath, pallor, etc. He has a long history of unexplained, massive bruising (like, covering both his thighs, or his mid-torso). This comes and goes and he's never had a blood test or seen his GP during a bruising episode, but he has reported this to his doctor. On and off history of bleeding gums. And this week he admitted to me that his long bones ache. He showed me his blood tests so I did see the scores,  but he then took the paperwork away from me and filed them at work. I have asked for a copy and he won't give me one,  because he knows I am prone to worry too much. He tends to worry too, and I know he is much more worried than he is letting on to me.  `ANSWER: Would be helpful with the exact values of the CBC. And B12, Folate and Ferritin values.Are liver and kidney function tests okay?What are his ethnic origins?,Is he diabetic. Does he take any other medication?,Does he take aspirin?Did he test for fecal blood?,But even tested, to me it looks like the most potential culprit. Fecal blood tests are not very good and even low doses ASA can result in micro hemorrhage that could potentially lead to this chronic anemia. His RDW could help in this analysis. ,Please, make sure to update here in case of any news.,As for ms and anemia, the most common us confusion between pernicious anemia and ms. I may be missing something, but can't really see a clear connection. I am a family physician in Brazil, we follow strict guidelines for high-costing procedures. I really can't follow the rationale for the MRI, but I could be wrong and missing something of the big picture here. I understand - if that's the case - that a bone marrow examination could be WAY more cost-efficient now. But seriously, I am still bugged by that aspirin. :-),It's funny how we men are harder to one about symptoms and other health issues, I wish you the best of luck.

If, as results come, I can be of any help, do not hesitate in calling again. \n",
            "`QUESTION: 2 weeks after scaphoid surgery (they put a screw in). I'm randomly in immense pain after I was seemingly doing fine. Whats going on?I am a 22 y/o male5'11180 lbswhiteThis has been going on for a few hours nowcurrent medicine: hydrocodone 5The first week of recovery was fine, they took the stitches out and said the incision was healing nicely. They put a cast on (which surprisingly was less restricting than the thumb spike brace I had on for recovery) and its been exactly a week with the cast. I work where its almost impossible to not use my hand so unfortunately i've been using it a bit, but it hasn't really bothered me too much. This morning I noticed my fingers were a bit stiff and as the day progressed they began to hurt to the point where it hurt to grab anything with it (its now at its worst where I cant even button my pants and its even hard to type this). about 4 hours ago my wrist started hurting as well, but not just the side I got surgery on. My entire wrist hurts as well as the part where the scaphoid is. Even with just keeping it still while elevated above my heart for an hour there is pain but when moving it the pain worsens. Unfortunately I have a really high tolerance to pain meds so my hydrocodone doesn't really get rid of the pain.Any help is greatly appreciated. This hurts really badEdit: Now most of the pain is on the opposite part of my wrist and really flares up when I move my fingers up... I feel like I'm going crazy because this has never happened to me before..  `ANSWER: This sounds very bad. You would rate your pain a 10 out of 10, yes? You should go to an emergency room. Go now!!!,It's good that the pain has diminished. I was jumping to the worst case scenario, which is an infection. I would still go see a doctor as soon as possible to rule out infection. `QUESTION: Got hit in the throat[deleted] `ANSWER: You’ll be okay. Give it a few days rest and the pain should completely subside.  You may notice that warm/hot foods and beverages will increase the pain, and you may wish to avoid those. Pay a visit to your doctor or a local clinic if the pain takes a sharp turn for the worse.  `QUESTION: I was bitten by a dog 3 weeks ago the dog was quarantined and showed no sings of rabies, but my arm still hurts and feels like it's burning .As the title said I was bitten by a dog 3 weeks ago and the dog was quarantined and showed no sings of rabies, but my arm still hurts and feels like it's burning, also I have random twitching muscles in my left leg, I was bitten in my right arm. Right under my elbow. I would put a picture but you can't see it any more it's fully healed. Should I worry ? Or is it that the my muscles are still repairing the selfs ? Sorry for any spelling errors . :) `ANSWER: Were you prescribed antibiotics at the time of the injury?When was your last tetanus shot? `QUESTION: Girlfriend and I were just rear-ended. Definitely feeling it in our necks. Should we be worried about doing anything wrong to make it worse?So, we'll be seeing a doctor tomorrow probably. This is mainly for tonight and a bit of tomorrow. We got rear-ended about two hours ago. Our necks are sore. We felt a small bit of pressure in our ears and now have some headaches. She's concerned of concussion type issues. I'm not so sure. We just want to make sure that we're cool for the night by just taking it easy and laying low. Thanks for the advice.  `ANSWER: My immediate guess would be whiplash. Back and/or neck pain following a road traffic accident always warrants a doctors visit - so make sure you both make that appointment tomorrow. If it does turn out to be whiplash, the treatment for is fairly conservative. Painkillers and gentle neck exercises. Unfortunately, injuries like these get worse before they get better. I would recommend you both take some paracetamol and/or ibuprofen now, if you haven't already.  `QUESTION: Terrible hospital experience when recieving 7 staples in my knee. Concidering going to a better hospital?UPDATE: I did go to the recommended hospital, they were shocked at the lack of treatment received. The poor irrigation and sterilization. They agreed it was warmer than usually and just to watch it. They were abhorred by the staple job and because of my symptoms they referred me to a specialist to get an MRI after the staples are removed. Got fantastic pain relieving meds in the hospital, a script for effective medication, gauze, tape, bactrim. And a leg brace. They also agreed that filling a complaint with the other hospital was not out of line... So thanks for all your help.... Really. (¬､¬)Original post:Today I was walking in the grass and did not anticipate a ditch that had me fall and shove my knee full force into the edge of a gas pipe tap between the sidewalk and the yard, straight to the bone. It went straight in and dug under a good bit. Concerned neighbors came and talked to me and called 911 and there was my first ambulance ride... For a cut knee. The driver of the ambiance was a dick, the woman with me in the back was wonderful. I immediately felt judged for being ambulance driven for a gashed knee to the ER. This thing hurt, non weight bearing, couldn't bend my leg, whole leg hurt, crying, blah blah blah, no pain medication, the radiographs were excruciating, still no pain relief, I came back wailing. Still no pain relief, I try explaining the gas plate dug in and under a good amount, at some point a PA stopped in for about 30 seconds to tell a nurse to give me Tylenol ONLY while I was there and staple it shut and send me home. No concern for a possible twisted knee or ligament/tendon/muscle damage, because again, it traveled a some distance into and under the top of my knee starting from the center at the bone.I literally screamed with the lidocaine injections, she was getting more frustrated, \"it's just lidocaine\", she says. I had two stitches in my thumb irrigated longer than she irrigated this mangled knee vagina, which constantly kept spewing out fatty tissue. She had to cut tissue away just to be able to close it with I believe 7 staples. She was delicate and precise, problem is I felt the full pain and force of every one so when I started crying and insisting it was the truth on the third she pumped the rest in helter skelter, told me she was done and left. My leg is non weight bearing, you can not touch within a good 10 inch radius of the injury and the entire leg is a bit more red and swollen and warmer than the other. If I don't more AT ALL its bearable. If I move, I cry. It takes everything I have to get out of bed if I need the rest room. And everything I have to sit on the damn toilet. Everyone keeps telling me I went to the wrong hospital and should have gone to a  specific other one in the next county over.So do I try an urgent care center if it's excruciating tomorrow like this or do I go to the recommended hospital?I feel like what they did was on some levels inhumane. I've been told by multiple persons a complaint would be appropriate action. This is older men and women who are were RNs and 911 operators.I'm 27 y/o 5'9\" female 250lbs and nothing else really relevant.Thanks.. `ANSWER: What was inhumane? What did you expect? A hug? Morphine? I don't know if I'm missing something here?What's with all the deleted comments below? ,If it wasn't irrigated properly, then obviously they've done wrong. But for the most part, it just sounds like you were panicked and distressed. Perhaps I'm picturing something far more innocuous than it was though. ,You hurt yourself, and it's not going to be painless healing. If you are still in pain, take some Ibuprofen (prescription NSAIDs would just be a higher dosage ibuprofen, most likely). I'm sure that they verified on the imaging that it hadn't damaged the bone and other tissues. My only other worry would be to make sure your tetanus immunization was up-to-date, which I'm sure they did as well. At this point, another doctor isn't going to do anything to help, because you just need time. `QUESTION: Pinched Nerve in NeckHello I’m a 19 year old Caucasian male. Im 5’5” and weigh 140 lbs.I pinched a nerve in my neck earlier lifting weights. I turned my head to the left too quickly and I felt a quick pain. This was 6 hours ago and the pain has no subsided. It seems to be located on the left side of my neck as this location has the most discomfort. Earlier I was able to keep my head up straight but now it’s leaning to the right because of the discomfort. I have no previous history of any medical conditions nor am I on any medication. Any advice on easing this pain, and/or allowing my neck to at least straighten up to appear normal?  `ANSWER: You didn't pinch a nerve, you actually strained your neck muscle. It's very common and it happened to me once or twice with very severe pain.  Best thing to do is to rest the area and take tylenol+advil.  It will get better on its own in a few days. If after a week it's not getting better or getting worse, see your GP.hope this helped `QUESTION: Sprained ankle, can't walk at all and 500mg naproxen not helpingI twisted my ankle yesterday and had to leave school early. When I got to the hospital they did an xray and said it wasn't a fracture than my doctor prescribed naproxen for the next few weeks and gave me an ace bandage.I didn't get crutches, a boot, or even a wheelchair, and I was never asked how much it hurt. The pain is so bad it makes me cry, and kept me awake last night. I woke up and the bandage had come off, and it took an hour to get it back on because it hurts even if I'm just moving my leg and not my ankle. What can I do? Should I call and complain, or attempt to go back and do it in person. I feel like there might have been some incompetence in my doctors decisions, and that I should have gotten at least something to help me move.  `ANSWER: You took ibuprofen as well as naproxen? ,Take some paracetamol too. 1000mg every 4-6 hours. ,Put a brace on.,Just popping in to agree that you should definitely not be taking both ibuprofen and naproxen! They're both NSAIDs and may cause internal bleeding and GI ulceration. That being said, what your doctor prescribed is the best option for a sprain as it reduces pain and inflammation. More important, though,  is the RICE technique a couple others have mentioned. Be sure not to exceed daily recommended dosing for your pain medications, as it likely won't help much more with pain and will have additional side effects. ,This ^ ,This ^ Yes, sorry for the delay. Hectic day..Take a NSAID (either Naproxen **or** ibuprofen) and also take some paracetamol (Tylenol)Best not to take your chosen NSAID and paracetamol at the same time - Not because it's dangerous, but because if you space these out and alternate between drugs, it will manage your pain better - Example...take your dose of ibuprofen/naproxen, then 2-3 hours later take some Tylenol, 2-3 hours later more ibuprofen/naproxen...2-3 hours later more paracetamol ...and so on)Doing this should provide consistent pain relief all day and through the night.I hope this makes sense. Take care.  `QUESTION: Shoulder sore 6 hours after vaccination.[deleted] `ANSWER: If you're still sore in a few days go back to your doc. You just got three inoculations, your shoulder is going to be sore for a bit. Don't panic or self diagnose anything. ,Which shots specifically? The tetanus vaccine commonly leaves people feeling sore for a day or two. I've heard that the HPV vaccine also does. `QUESTION: My lower back hurts like hellI lifted something heavy and I stupidly lifted with my back instead of my legs and now my lower back is in a lot of pain. It hurts to walk and lie down and sit up. What's the best treatment for this? `ANSWER: Ibuprofen,Where is this 2-3 day coming from?,Wow was that a biased editorial I just read.  Anyway, I've seen some *human* data on long bone fractures and NSAIDs that showed a possible decrease in healing but it was of questionable significance.  There is probably enough data to say - don't use ibuprofen after your back doesn't hurt anymore.  If that's more than 2-3 days.. I don't know that there's enough there to say well now you're magically causing harm at 48 hours.,Agree.. There has been a shift `QUESTION: Reaction to a tetanus or flu vaccine (got both, not sure which one is reacting), painful, but not deadly, should I see a doctor, or just treat?29, Female, USA.I got a tetanus booster and a flu vaccine yesterday. I asked the nurse to put the most painful shot in my non-dominant arm. Well now I have a knot the size of bouncy ball in the muscle of my non-dominant arm. I *think* it was the tetanus shot.The knot is painful, very painful but not excruciating. I don't think I have any other symptoms except I'm a little lethargic today, but that could just be because it's my day off.Question: How long should I wait before I see a doctor? How do I make the pain go away?Ibuprofen or acetametaphin? Ice or heat?Thank you so much. I tried googling, but couldn't find anything other than acknowledging the possible side effects of vaccinations. `ANSWER: You don't have to go see a doctor, he or she can't do anything about it. A sore spot is quite common after a flu shot (mine was also quite mean this year). paracetamol is fine, ice can numb the pain a little. It will go away in a few days.  `QUESTION: Severe shoulder, neck and back pain after tetanus vaccinationA little less than a week ago I received my tetanus booster shot (the one you receive every decade, at least here in Australia).A few days later I began experiencing pain around my shoulder blade. This has been progressively getting worse, culminating this evening in a stiff neck and severe pain on my upper left back. It got to the point tonight where I could not move from a lying down position without my wife's assistance, and even then, the pain was excruciating. From what I've read, such a degree of pain days after the injection is unusual, but not unheard of. As it didn't click initially that my symptoms were related to the tetanus shot, I began treating it like a sports injury and have tried rest and ice. The ice tonight is what made it so bad. I have, therefore hit the pain killers and heat treatment. How long can I expect this to last? Is there anything else I can do to hasten recovery and relieve pain? Thanks in advance.  `ANSWER: I seriously don't think your pain derives from the vaccination.It looks like trapezoid contracture (is it the right word in english?).Heat and posture care should help you, elseways some muscular relaxant could be helpful.Anyways, at least here in Brazil, any suspicion of vac reaction should be promptly informed to health officers...\n",

Or something[deleted] `ANSWER: If you have insurance I'd recommend going to an orthopedic, and eventually an MRI of the knee.  `QUESTION: What is the procedure to mend a torn meniscus? (Answers for mild, moderate, and severe tears please)I'm running a race today on what I believe is a torn meniscus. I can run with no/little pain, but straightening my knee and bending it are difficult. As a secondary question, does that description sound like a torn meniscus?18 y/o, Male, 5'11, 140 lbs. `ANSWER: That could be symptoms of a meniscal tear. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to first get your knee problems diagnosed before you ask about treatment strategies in mild, moderate and severe cases? See your general practitioner or an orthopaedic surgeon. `QUESTION: Knee numb after falling a few days ago.In my hurry I fell from my bicycle Friday morning. I had a few scratches, but the pain went away after a few hours. My right knee also has some scratches, but all exterior pain is gone. However, today my knee still feels weird. This concerns only the upper part of the knee.There's no obvious bruising or anything. It doesn't hurt either. There's just a weird tingly sensation when I tap or touch it. Sitting, standing or laying for a while and changing positions (bending my knee) also gives strange tingly numbing sensations. Trying to fold that leg gives me a sense of uncomfortableness, which borders on pain, but it's not pain. Walking feels weird. Doing anything with that leg feels weird.Am I safe to walk, bicycle and move about normally? `ANSWER: If you are worried about it, you should have it examined by a doctor for any signs of ligament damage.If it happened 3-4 days ago, some of the unusual symptoms you are describing could be from inflammation or fluid accumulation from within the joint which will make it feel stiff and hard to move.Activity as tolerated if usually fine with most minor knee injuries, but it's impossible to give specific advice without having your knee examined by a professional,Sounds like \"fluid on the knee\" from the initial injury.  Probably nothing serious, try babying it for few days, get it checked out if it persists. `QUESTION: How can I diagnose chronic knee pain? Who should I see?I'm a 30 year old 170lb male, I played a lot of sports and was very active until about 24, then I got a full time sedentary job. I'm sitting 90% of my day. During my weekends I try to play rec sports, run, bike, etc, but my knees begin hurting immediately. My ankles hurt too, and eventually I will have tendonitis (I think) and my lower back can even hurt. I am pretty sure I had a slipped disc, but that's another story.I want to fix all of these problems but I don't know who to see. I have a family doctor but I'd rather go straight to the expert. Maybe this indicates an underlying issue, or maybe I just need to use my joints more often and apply some kind of therapy. I want to play some soccer this spring and summer but I dread having to sit after 15 minutes from excruciating joint pain :( `ANSWER: Did you have any trauma to the knee? Hip? Back? At all? Is the pain constant? Or only after exercise? Have you tried using ice on the knees/ankles after exercise? Tried taking ibuprofen/Tylenol? ,My first thoughts would definitely be light exercise. Your joints probably hurt from inflammation now not an old injury. If you don't use it for a while the muscles with shrink and the joint will be less stable. Start with low impact exercise (biking / swimming) and build up your strength and tolerance. Then make sure to use ice and just slowly build to a steady routine. The \"quick fix\" you are asking for doesn't exist. It just doesn't. Even a complete joint replacement (please don't do that) won't 100% fix things. ,Happy to help. And just because it is a last resort and definitely a point of no return. I think the body (even when semi-broken) is still a pretty damn well put together machine. We have come a long way in joint replacements but still the body adapts to trauma relatively well and can usually compensate and make things work fine. So then replacing the joint is basically another major trauma to heal from, but with foreign things.  `QUESTION: Knee popped out.Age 28sex maleheight 5.5 ishweight 250 ishrace whiteDuration of complaint Around 4/22Location pa philly and right knee capexisting conditions none that I can recallmedicine  allergie medicine,  adderallI was standing at a junk yard and I dont know how but I felt my knee shift and give. I dont know if I fell or threw myself down from the unique pain (something in itself ). But after recovering my knee was swollen and sure and fells weakened. I got a brace.I noticed a clicking in certain situations froM my knee and it is loud enough to here and makes enough of a click pop I can feel something move in the knee if I hold a hand over it.What happened?  How bad did I mess my leg up? Who do I see? What to expect? Thanks for any help. `ANSWER: When did this happen? I'm guessing you went to the ER? ,Likely a meniscal injury. Go see an Orthopaedic surgeon. ,Not necessarily surgery. You'll need to be examined, but clicking/catching usually mean meniscus injury. May need an MRI, likely PT.  `QUESTION: Knee swelling after surgery wont go down after surgeryThe other year, I tore my meniscus, ACL, MCL and my patella tendon all in my right knee. I underwent 2 surgeries to fix this. The first one being on the day of the incident, fixing my meniscus, MCL and patella tendon and the most recent about 6 months ago, where they replaced my ACL with an allograft. I recently finished going through rehab and I was assured the swelling would go down. The swelling has not gone done and is on the lateral side of my knee. The swelling is to an extent that limits some of my daily activities and can be hard to get my knee fully extended. I am at school now and it is hard to make out to my Doctor for a follow up. Is this something that will go away or this there any operation that could help this? `ANSWER: You're always going to have some swelling in the knee, unfortunately, but it can take up to a year to reach maximum improvement postop. If it's limiting your activities though, would consider going to see a doc locally.  `QUESTION: Fell on my knee - looking for advice to reduce inflammation8 fays ago I tripped over a root walking through some trees and fell over a curb, onto asphalt, landing on my palm and my right knee.My wrist has healed alright, and my knee has also started to heal as well. I have noticed a few things still wrong with the knee injury, though.Whenever my knee goes over my toes, and pressure gets put on it (pushing off with the top of my foot off of the floor, etc.) I feel a pain in my lower knee, below and slightly to the left of my knee cap. If I sit down and poke around that area with my thumb and some pressure I can find the ligament/tendon that is inflamed and hurting. I'm a pretty avid gym-goer and this injury hasn't affected my deadlifts or lunges, but if I have a little bit of the wrong stature during squats, I feel a pain in the area I described. I have to keep strict form, where my knees never go over my toes, and even then I feel a slight pressure in my knee.I would just like to get some advice on some PT exercises I could do? Perhaps some OTC anti-inflammatory drugs I could take? I've been wearing a compression sleeve on and off and it's taken away some of the inflammation but this lingering bit is bothersome.Thank you ahead of time :) `ANSWER: Sounds like a ligamentous injury, just as you suspect. Ibuprofen or naproxen are both good OTC NSAIDS you could use for a limited time, assuming you don't have any chronic medical conditions (e.g., kidney problems). Other than that I would just take it easy on your knees for a week or so. Skip a few leg days :). Instead of a calf compression sleeve try knee brace/compression instead. It will heal on its own, give it time. Any popping or locking sensations could be a red flag for something more serious, like a meniscus or ACL injury. I would expect you to be in a lot more pain though.  `QUESTION: Went for a run and now my left knee is swollen and in pain?I can feel a dull ache if I'm not moving my left knee, but when I bend it or straighten it out, it hurts more. I can feel swelling below and around my left kneecap. Thing is, when I bend my left leg so my ankle is going towards my buttocks, and then straighten it out again, I can hear a click, a clicking noise from my knee. What the hell happened? Was it because when I ran I ran too hard or used the wrong shoes? (Converse on pavement)  `ANSWER: I wonder if you have what I have. 2 years ago the same thing happened to me. I went to dance class and afterwards for a week, my right knee was swollen and had a dull ache. It was painful when I would walk up or down steps or walk down a hill. I was diagnosed with chondromalacia patella which is not dangerous but common in runners. My sports medicine doctor said that I have bone spurs, and also certain muscles in my legs are weak. So when I dance, because some of my leg muscles are weak , it's pulling on my knee cap causing swelling. I'm seeing a sports medicine doctor now because my knee has been swelling up again. I've been doing physical therapy as ordered by my doctor.Try making an appointment with a sports medicine doctor, who is an orthopedic doctor that specializes in exercise related injuries. He/she can really diagnose what's going on. It's hard to say without an xray, but if your knee is swollen and achy, you should definitely have it checked out. As for the clicking, my doctor said it's common if it doesn't hurt but mention that to the sports medicine doctor also. `QUESTION: Knee injury* 22* Male* 177cm (5'10'')* 67kg (148lbs)* White/CaucasianBackground story:Been playing football (soccer) at least once every week for about 4 years now. I've also been exercising at home for about a year and a half. The rest of my time isn't so sporty. I spend a lot of time in front of my computer and have been since I started IT studies 4 years ago. I just started working in WebDev a few months ago so these past few months I've been spending at least 7 hours a day in front of a computer and probably about 3-5 hours when I'm home.I've never had trouble with my knees before. My injury happened when I wanted to start getting back my stamina 2 weeks ago and went on a 5km jog. I barely ran 2 of them and I walked the rest. I also took a few rests in between my runs. In any case, when I took my 2.5km break I felt my calves being really sore. I ran lightly a little and then walked back the rest. I didn't feel anything in my knee.The next day my left knee started to hurt. I could barely walk. My calves were sore but I've dealt with DOMS before so I wasn't worried about them. I took a break from next week's football and ended up not playing football or running for 11 days. My knee felt completely healed. Then I went out for an hour and a half of football and the pain came back. I played the whole match but it was really uncomfortable by the end of it. That was yesterday. Today my knee feels even worse than last time.My pain can be described as:General discomfort. There are very few random positions that I can put my leg in while sitting where I don't feel any discomfort or pain. Walking is impossible without limping. My knee hurts most when I move it (bend or straighten). I'm no doctor but I was looking at [this image](http://www.christuslivewell.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Knee-Anatomy.jpg) and I feel like the pain is probably in my patellar or quadriceps tendon. It's definitely not in any of the ligaments on the side but it may be my ACL or anything from inside my knee. I know I can definitely feel pain if I press upon a certain central position on top of my patella. There is no visible swelling whatsoever though. I can actually sometimes feel it squeak like an old door hinge..I have to walk 20 minutes to work and back every day, so this is really uncomfortable for me. Can someone please tell me what I should do or at least how long I should rest and how to know when my knee is fully healed? `ANSWER: I'm not too good with knee diagnoses but I'd say stop walking to work for at least a few weeks (rest it), ice it, put an ACE wrap on it and take some ibuprofen or other NSAID regularly for a few weeks.  `QUESTION: Knee problemHere's the run down.  This past weekend my wife and I took part in a 3-day walk for breast cancer.  It was 60 miles, so clearly a lot of work on my knees.  Day 1 went fine, feet hurt, but to be expected.  Day two came and I was having issues with my right foot's arch.  So I am assuming I was compensating my leg around my arch.  That night I bought decent insoles to help and they did.  However my right knee (same leg) was killing me.  I woke up on day 3 with a swollen knee.  I completed the walk day 3 with lots of stop and icing along with ibprofen.  My knee was very swollen and where I got scared was it was buckling a few times.  I have never experienced that (I am 28 and play tons of sports).  This freaked me out a lot.  I took off work yesterday to sort of recoup.  I woke up in pain with a swollen knee which I sort of knew was coming.  I kept it elevated all day, with icing it on and off all day while also taking anti-inflamatory drugs.  Steps were a big issue, I had to take each one at a time, not putting my forward body's weight on that knee.Woke up this morning (Tuesday- 2 days after the walk) with a slightly swollen knee and a decent amount of stiffness. I am okay with that at this point.  I dont have the crazy pain on every step I take which is also good.  However, I do occasionally have my knee buckle.Edit: Family friend had me wear a knee brace today and have been taking asprin instead of ibprofen.  Still have buckle every once and a while.My question is, should I really be concerned? Is this just to be assumed from a lot of use in a short period of time? When is the time where a flag should go up and I should get an MRI? Could I seriously tear my minuscus WALKING?I have never had any major knee issue/injury/surgery.  This question has been asked several times by medic staff, so I figured would be needed here.THANKS IN ADVANCE! `ANSWER: It's possible that you caused some damage while playing sports and now with a heavy amount of activity caused aggravation of that injury. Its possible to cause a small tear in a meniscus and go years without any problems until a specific event causes extra aggravation. The swelling, stiffness, and inability to hold your weight is a good indication that there could be some ligamental damage. My suggestion would be to find a sports medicine physician, you can do this by contacting your insurance company or your family doctor, and go have a proper evaluation. A written description with joint injuries is very limiting, you need a doctor to perform a physical exam to tell you for sure. For now, avoid extensive physical activity and keep it iced. Ibuprofen or aspirin are also good to help with pain and inflammation. Let me know how things go.\n"

            "`QUESTION: I hit a electrified wire fence while dirtbiking..While riding a lil 50cc I rode into a electric wire fence, took one wire well across the chest just under my tits and now often whenever I bend over my left nostril (only left) drips super yellow snot, feels like a nosebleed but no blood. what did I do to myself? `ANSWER: When did this happen? `QUESTION: Hit my head, need some adviceI hit my head at a concert last night pretty hard, someone headbutted or elbowed me, i don't know.  I didn't black out or anything, no nausea.  I was drunk when it happened, and I still kept going after that.  (It was a metal concert so a lot of screaming, headbanging, and great things to do after you hit your head really hard.  I went home, went to bed, had a terrible dream,(unrelated), and woke up a couple times during the night feeling disoriented.  Woke up this morning, have a consistent headache and I guess dizziness and felt slow to respond to things, it's hard to describe.  It could just be my sinuses too, its very dry out right now.  I can't really tell if it's a hangover or if it's possibly a concussion.  Either way, is it important I get it checked out?  I feel a doctor would just tell me to rest regardless and it would just be a waste of money.  Male22 Caucasian5'7180lbsno meds or med issues `ANSWER: It sounds like a possible concussion.Hard to rule out more serious things like bleeding in the brain, though very rare, without having a doctor do a neurologic exam. `QUESTION: My heart rate is through the roofToday I took a BMI test, and scored a little under 23. Just to get the info that may be needed aside, here's what you need to know about me:I'm a male, I'm 5'6 and about 140 pounds, I am white, I take no medication,and  cancer runs in my family (I don't know if that's relevant).My stationary heart rate is about 130 at times. This really scares me, especially since I have problems standing up. I get head rushes so bad I pass out maybe 70-80% of the time I stand up, no matter how slowly I do. I don't know what else you'd need to know about me. Any help, doc? `ANSWER: &gt; I pass out maybe 70-80% of the time I stand upYou pass out? To me..passing out means you fainted - you lost consciousness briefly and fell to the floor. Does it mean something else to you? ,..What age are you?  `QUESTION: I've been passing out frequently? whats the difference between passing out or a seizure?Since february I have passed out 4 times, which seems like a lot but maybe it's normal, i don't know. The first time I was in ceramics class and I was listening to a critique and then next thing I know everyone is looking at me and asking if I'm ok and I'm on the ground and I don't remember a thing. I felt fine after. The next two times I was alone at my house so I have no idea what happened, I just remember working on dinner and then I'm on the ground, felt like it was only a second. The most recent time however was kind of different and this was yesterday. I was with 3 of my friends at their house we were just hanging out and I start getting my stuff together because i had to meet up with my boyfriend, and then (I don't remember a lot) but my friend was holding my arms trying to keep me balanced and I was totally out of it. Then I was on the ground so I tried to get up and she helped me stand up and I went to go down the stairs and I totally lost consciousness again and fell down the stairs pretty hard (apparently, like I said I don't remember really any of this) and then they helped me up again and I don't know what happened but I remember seeing really bright light and I was outside and I guess I fell down again and then got up, passed out again, and they carried me to the front steps and I was able to kind of \"wake up\" at that point and I was feeling super weird the rest of the day, but I think that was just cause I hit my head really hard. I also pissed myself. And the whole process from the first time I passed out to when I was able to get myself awake and had control of my body was about 10-15 minutes. I don't remember much at all, most is totally black and I have some fuzzy memories of parts of it. I don't have any cardiovascular issues that I am aware of, and I drink plenty of water, am active and eat well, over all a healthy person. I'm a 19 year old female, 5'8\" and 140lbs. and I have a medical history of asthma when I was a kid, but no other physical medical history really. What could be the cause? should I be concerned? Any insight would be helpful. `ANSWER: So there doesn't seem to be anything that makes you lose consciousness? Heat, stress, standing up for long periods, pain? I understand you don't feel like you're going to pass out? Dizzy, visual problems, sweating? Any palpitations? Did you lose you bladder control any of the other times? Do you make any movements or sounds when you were passed out according to the witnesses? If you wake up, do you know where you are or are you confused for some time? Any family history of epilepsy? Have you noticed any muscle twitching, especially just after you woke up?Based on your story, there are some things not typical for just 'fainting', I would suggest you discuss this with your PCP.In general: 'passing out' is used to describe a vasovagal collaps: a reflex, triggered by something like pain or emotion where the blood pressure drops and people faint. Usually preceded by lightheadedness, dizziness, sweating and the like. Usually benign (although people can injure themselves when falling). Seizures are the result of epileptic activity in the brain; which can be part of an epileptic syndrome, caused by an underlying other brain disease. Sometimes, otherwise healthy people can have epileptic seizures in certain circumstances. A febrile seizure in infants for example, or a seizure because of sleep deprivation or substance abuse.,If you mean with immediately: contact your PCP for an appointment as soon as possible, sure. Rushing to the ER with the complaint of loss of consciousness yesterday doesn't seem like the most efficient approach. `QUESTION: loud sound in my head at various timesso this has been happening to me quite frequently and I have no idea what's wrong with me. it never used to happen but a while ago, I don't remember how long, I started getting  loud noises in my head whenever I try to sleep, I'm about to fall asleep, or when I simply lay down and close my eyes. it sounds like an old camera flash like \"PPPHHHOOOOSH\" and sometimes its accompanied by a flash in my eyes (closed), and when it happens right as I'm about to fall asleep it makes me jerk awake. anyone know what this could possibly be? is it dangerous?I know it scares the hell out of me sometimes. `ANSWER: Sounds like exploding head syndrome. Probably a variant of the feeling that you're falling right before you fall asleep (hypnic jerk). `QUESTION: Numbness and pins and needles in fingersIf it helps I'm 18, female, 84 pounds, and 5.4 feet tall.Both of my hands started going numb around 6 PM (Eastern) yesterday, and then, when I touched an object the fingertips began to sting and tingle. The skin on them also started to get reddish. I put some Nivea lotion on them to soothe the redness, and thankfully it went away in a couple of hours. I woke up around an hour ago and realized I could handle things with my right hand again without stinging, but my left hand still feels numb, especially on my index finger which has a small paper cut near the tip.I'm not too worried about this and it's not bothering me too much, but a diagnosis would be helpful in getting rid of it.Thanks in advance. `ANSWER: Was this a one time incident, or something that happens regularly?,Unless it starts happening regularly you don't need to concern yourself.  `QUESTION: Sudden Blackout(Seizure)A few minutes ago I stood up having been sitting down for quite a while.  As happens quite regularly on doing this I had a few seconds of dizzyness.  This time, however it did not wear off momentarily.    I went into an almost dreamlike state and woke a minute or two later leaning against a chair with my entire body feeling like I was shaking.    I have no history of anything like this.  I am: 18, male, from the UK, around 6ft and 10 stone .  I am not on medication or anything like that.  The only thing out of the ordinary is that earlier today I had my blood taken for the first time in my life.Is this something serious, it is currently scaring the living shit out of me.  Any ideas?  If you want any more info please ask. `ANSWER: Naturally, over the internet I can't provide any type of definitive diagnosis, but&gt;I stood up having been sitting down for quite a while. As happens quite regularly on doing this I had a few seconds of dizzyness.sounds quite classically like [orthostatic hypotension](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthostatic_hypotension), which if it is happening regularly appears to be a longstanding issue for you.As described in the article, all of the symptoms you experienced today can also be attributed to OH, including your \"dreamlike state\". Though it is possible, I doubt you actually experienced a seizure. While the amount of blood drawn for typical studies is not enough to drop your blood pressure significantly, if you have a history of dizzyness on standing and maybe were dehydrated (did you fast for the blood test?) it might have exacerbated enough to cause a more significant reaction.It's most likely nothing to worry about. `QUESTION: I think I just had a seizure. I'm not too sure please help or advise.About ten minutes ago, around five A.M. I was reading on my phone while laying in bed for an assignment due tomorrow. My room was very warm so I stood up to close the vent on my ceiling. The second I was on my feet my entire body started to convulse and for ten seconds I lost all motor control and fell to the floor. As my body just shook. Nothing like this has happened before and I'm pretty scared. Should I call 911 or am I fine and should get some sleep?I'm 20 MaleI would like to point out two things differently than today. First I have almost been awake for 24 hours. Some assignments have crept up on me faster than expected. Second I'm prescribed adderall 10 mg IR in the mornings and ten in the evenings. Since I have been awake for 24 hours working I have take a total of 30 mg during this time. Other than a stiff neck from the shaking and the anxiety of what to do I feel fine.  `ANSWER: Go to the hospital. If its nothing its nothing, but it sounds like you indeed had a seizure. Edit: Sounds like it could be presyncope, which I don't know too much about. In either case it demands a prompt response.,I don't think this was a seizure because you did not lose consciousness, but i do think you should go see a doctor anyway,This `QUESTION: Had a strange experience last night.Woke up in the middle of the night to take a leak. As I flushed the toilet I remember standing there feeling very light headed. I turned around and started to walk back to bed but never made it. Apparently I passed out. When I came to, my wife was pretty freaked out and I felt like crap but, i've been knocked out in the past and it felt similar. I hit my head on the sliding glass shower door and have a decent sized knot so I wonder if I had a concussion, the thought crossed my mind last night as well but I said screw it and went back to bed. This morning, while playing it back in my head I can't figure out what happened. I've never randomly passed out before, any thoughts??Background: Male, mid 20's. 5'9. 165 lbs. 15%-ish body fat. Regularly active. Non smoker. No history of randomly fainting..edit: My wife said that from the time she heard me fall to the time I came to must've been around 2 minutes. She said my eyes were open but glazed, and that my body was stiff but not convulsing. Also she said that I was making some sort of sound that she couldn't describe. `ANSWER: Sounds like you had an episode of positional hypotension leading to syncope, or in other words, you stood up too fast causing a drop in blood pressure which made you pass out. If this was a one time thing you don't need to worry about it. Its possible that you could have been dehydrated. I'm more concerned about you hitting your head. If you ever pass out and hit your head that hard your should really go to the hospital for a CT scan. I know you posted 10 days ago, so keep that in mind for the future.  `QUESTION: I think I just had a seizure?* Age:25* Sex: F* Height 5'4* Weight 180* Race Hispanic/Native American* Duration of complaint 30 Seconds?* Location (Geographic and on body): US, All over I guess* Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): Headaches, possibly cluster headaches but mostly chronic migraines.* Current medications (if any): NoneSo around 2PM today, I sat down and took a drink of water. I started choking and got the really bad pain when something doesnt go down right and my heart was hurting quite badly. My breathing was painful but I was still able to breathe regularly. After about 15 seconds of that, I fell backwards and my muscles completely stiffened. I blacked out and vaguely recall burning in my ears and fingertips. When I regained consciousness (maybe 30 seconds later), I felt disoriented and tired. Nothings happened since then and the feeling of being \"off\" has gradually faded eight hours later. I do have a history of extremely bad headaches but that's all I can think of that'd be relevant. This is the first time something like this has happened.Pretty much just want to know if I should brave the emergency room on a Friday night or make an appointment later in the week.... or if it's even necessary. Thanks guys! `ANSWER: So you started choking and fell to the floor and blacked out very briefly? That sounds more like a fainting episode than a seizure. You are generally *very* confused for quite a while after a seizure, and it can be accompanied by loss of control of your bladder/bowel, tongue biting etc. It's possible it could have been either but fainting (syncope) seems more consistent with following a choking fit. I'm not sure if the history of migraine is relevant, it could be. Was it actually diagnosed as migraine and how long have you been getting them? I'm thinking because it happened once after a clear precipitating event and seems to have resolved now I wouldn't bother going to the ED. I would try and make an appointment just so you can get a clearer idea of what happened and they can run a few checks like an examination, EKG etc. I'd go to the emergency department if it happened again, you had difficulty breathing or you became progressively more unwell. If that was the case I'd suggest you don't drive to hospital, get a lift or call an ambulance.  `QUESTION: Had a strange experience last night.Woke up in the middle of the night to take a leak.

            "`QUESTION: Urgent care or walk in clinic?[deleted] `ANSWER: There's no practical distinction between a walk-in clinic and an urgent care. Both are there for things that can't wait for your primary care but aren't emergencies. Based on the description of your symptoms, I would recommend you go to whichever one is convenient / takes your insurance. ,Doesn't mean his insurance will necessarily pay for it. Many require referrals from primary care for specialists.  `QUESTION: PLEASE URGENT HELP NEEDEDHello I'm 14 and my mom just received a call from my teacher about skipping his class. She became extremely angry and after about 20 minutes of nonstop crying, she felt weak and asked her to drag her to the carpet so she could lay down, I carried her onto the coach and she had trouble breathing, numbness on hands and feet and felt really cold. She is currently sleeping but are these symptoms from her high blood pressure and diabetes? She also randomly open her eyes and asked me two questions. Where is dad? And what day of the week it was. Both these questions she normally knew the answer to. She begged me not to call the police so if there's anything I can do before I have to call, please tell me `ANSWER: Call 911 and get help.,You aren't calling the police. You are calling for paramedics to help your mom,And get some family therapy. Seems not like the way a child should grow up. But first call an ambulance – that might be more urgent right now. `QUESTION: Serotonin overdose????? URGENT[removed] `ANSWER: Your friend needs urgent medical attention.

It's about my dad. He is in his late 60s, is about 5'9, 250+ pounds I'm guessing (pretty big in comparison to his height), white, he is a college teacher and he lives in southern California. He does NOT smoke and never drinks. He rarely sees the doctor, usually baring through wounds and sicknesses with surprising willpower. ******SKIP ALL THE FOLLOWING TO THE TLDR SECTION**  if time is important to you. I typed all this and i want include it for people who want to know more, but after i finished it i realized it wasn't necessary to know, especially from a medical standpoint.******I do not live with my dad. I spend all school-year in New Mexico with my mom. Every summer, and some holidays, i fly out to California to see my dad. He's really a cool guy. When I'm here, we always have a good time. We go to the San Diego Zoo, Wild animal park, Beach, and Movies as our norms. We keep active by going to the gym together in the mornings occasionally, and we do plenty of things to keep us occupied. When my dad can't take me places, usually due to work, he leaves me at home and promises the next day we will do something more interesting. This was all the norm until this trip: Summer 2015. I arrived and everything seemed to going normal. We went to the beach twice and saw two movies. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. My dad had to teach for about another 10 days after my arrival in California, so i didn't expect TOO much in terms of doing stuff. I figured it would be nice to have a few days to relax. Fast forward to a few days ago. We hadn't done anything since the movies and beach. My dad was always at his chair next to his computer, doing something or another. Fine by me. He seemed busy with keeping his love interest(s) happy on Facebook or whatever. He promised, per usual, that we would soon do something besides staying at the house once he was available. Once again, fine by me. Now its yesterday, or 2 days ago depending on when you're reading this. Im having to walk to nearby restaurants to feed myself becuase he seemly forgot about getting me any food (or just assumed i could use his strange array of condiments, soda, and lunch meats in the fridge to feed myself). He is incredibly disengaged from me. Not sure if he's simply letting me do my own thing because he thinks I'm old enough, or because of some other reason. I notice my dad falls asleep spontaneously in his uncomfortable chair, only 20 feet away from his bed. I get up and walk around and make noise and he just stays passed out. His snoring is, per usual, very loud. I figured this was whatever, ya know? sleep where you want i guess. when he wakes up he can transfer himself to his bed if he wants. It gets late in the day, dad is half engaged. After feeding myself breakfast and then walking 30 minutes away (which i don't even think he realizes i did) to get lunch, dad finally seems to remember i need something from dinner. He bought one of those costco chickens beforehand, threw mine on a plate and tossed it in the microwave. While i ate, he made sure to emphasize how he needed to go to bed early so he could wake up early to go to his dentist appointment. Sounds good! He told me multiple times in a short span of time, only an hour or two, as if i would have forgotten. I assured him i remembered, He had an early dentist appointment. He made to tell me one more time, as if it was new information. I didn't notice it until just then, but it seems as though he forgets things (small things), probably just due to his age.Now its this morning. I wake up, its about 10 am-3 hours past my Dads scheduled dentist appointment. I get up, go out of my room to discover my dad, passed out completely on his chair, snoring up a storm. He has nothing but underwear on, which is usual. But this time, he had 'Busty teen gets big cock' full screen on his 27 inch computer, with a bottle of lotion tipped over on his cluttered desk. I pretend to not notice any of it, and walk past risky, making lots of noise so he wakes up. No cigar. The snoring continues. Im almost sure at this point that he had fallen asleep last night while about to do the deed, and therefore had slept right through his appointment. I figured it was pretty late in the day, he would wake up soon. I went back into my room and pretended i was still asleep. for an hour, i kept hearing my dad sound like he was waking up. A sudden inhale, like someone who just woke up from a bad dream. Nope. he was still out cold, but he kept making these sudden, seeming random inhaling noises. Finally, at 11, i heard his clicking on his computer. I gave him a few minutes so he could close out of the porn, and i could come out of my room conveniently after, ignorant of what happened. I came out of my room, but he still had the porn in the exact same spot. I pretended to not notice again. \"morning dad\". instead of closing out of it, he pulls the screen and rotates it so it faces me less. Umm ok then? i went and made breakfast, and gave him time to wake up and get himself together. I asked him what had happened to his dentist appointment. He said that the dentist had canceled since the surgeon wasn't there, and they had delayed his appointment by a week. I didn't expect him to have such an answer ready, but i still suspected he had just lied and missed it completely. Dad went into his room and went back to sleep, somewhat uncharacteristically. I passed by the computer again and the porn was still there! He just left it open, facing directly at my room. What was he thinking?? The screen was so big and so prominent that i could clearly see the porn without having to had leave my own bed (if the door had been open). I closed the Porn out for him, and put away his god damn lotion. My dad spent all day sleeping. Not like in his covers with the door shut though. He had walked to his bed after i had woke up, and just laid back on top of all the covers and everything with his legs not even on the bed. No pillow, no anything. I gave him some space, fed myself and just kept myself occupied. I left for about an our or two to get lunch, and when i came back same story. Once again, i heard him wake up sometimes. He inhaled and like shuffled around, but he just passed out again right after. late in the day, i began to worry. I asked him if he was okay. Yes. Are you sure? yes. I had been sick (and still am, so a small degree) just a week earlier, so i had pills. I put sleep and daytime pills, along with water, next to him in bed, and told him to take it if he was feeling ill. Ok. I asked him if he had work today. Im pretty sure he said yes i do, but if he did, then he didn't go. He just slept. Dad if you had work today, its like 4 pm, just so you know. Ok. I went out of my room just minutes ago, at like 11 pm, expecting my dad to be in bed. Once again, he was passed out in his chair. My movement, door closing, and getting a glass of water didn't wake him in the slightest. Embarrassingly, his penis was out this time. Im not sure if he was going to masturbate again or if he was hot or whatever, but it was out. and once again, it was RIGHT outside my room, so its not like i could miss him if i left my room (quite a common occurrence since my room is fairly small).Its currently 12:18 at night, and i spent way too much time writing his. i heard him get up just a minute ago and do something int he kitchen. He is usually very engaged and friendly and i remember him for having such a timed sleep schedule (from around 11 pm to exactly 6am, every time). This laziness and disengaged-ness is very unlike him. Along with his memory being seemingly spotty lately, i just wanted to make a post.******TLDR:** Dad is acting weird. We haven't done anything together in days, as he seems disengaged and not himself. He is uncharacteristically sleepy, and has spent all of today passed out in a seemingly uncomfortable position on his bed. He seemingly missed all of his appointments today, from his dentist to his class that he teaches, but he hasn't admitted to missing these things. He has weird stutter moment where it sounds like he's waking up and he inhales, but he is still asleep. He seems to be forgetting some things as well. Recently i was sick with sore throat, then clogged nose and occasional coughing. Took medicine and it had mostly passed, but it is clearly still present to a small degree. I have Dayquil and Nyquil I've been using regularly, and i gave some to my dad while he was in bed. Not sure if he used it. Dad mentioned a few days back that he is having some flem (stuff in your lungs/throat), but besides that he doesn't seem to be sick or to have gotten my cold. I will update this thread tomorrow to see if anything has developed. I understand if this post isn't very medical or if its impossible to determine his condition with only these observations available, but i feel obligated to do something. Advice is welcome. Thank you. `ANSWER: I don't disagree with u/Gravon, but I'm guessing since you're a kid (I'm assuming a teenager) *taking* your dad to the ER yourself might be difficult. Unless you have a car, and he agrees to go.. or you have the strength to carry a 250lb man out to your car. I think you should call someone. Do you have any family in the area? Are you or your dad close with any of your neighbours? If not, I'd recommend you do the following : Go into your dads room and say to him '' *I am really worried about you. I've just called an ambulance. I think we need to go to the hospital* '' - If he doesn't immediately get up, ask why and **coherently** explain he's fine, he just feels unwell/tired for XYZ reason    .. you should then go call for an ambulance. `QUESTION: My bud is freaking out and I can't calm him down much, maybe you guys can help?Basically he's been getting swelling and a growing lump on his right testicle, with swelling really bad in the veins above which is where the lump is and the lump goes down to his balls (dull pain on and off, light pressure in his thighs/abs/back, nausea, testicle hangs down lower than normal).  He went to the Dr. yesterday and she said it appeared to be epididymitis (spelling?) but she wasn't sure.  He had his urine tested, nothing out of the ordinary when checked in-house.  She sent it off to a lab to check for any STDs.  She also had him go get an ultrasound which came back with a cyst on his LEFT testicle (he's been having problem with the right) but other than that was normal, including blood flows.  The doctor then said it's probably just inflammation and to try elevating it and taking ibuprofen and if it's not getting better by the end of the week, they'll talk.He's freaking out thinking he has cancer or something really bad that didn't show up on the ultrasound.  I too find it odd that the swelling (which he told me his Dr. could see before even touching it and she was really surprised by it) would not show up on the ultrasound.  He did pull his boxers closer to his balls and even I could see it was REALLY swollen, especially above the testicle (inb4 you all call me a fag, he was freaking out and I'm just trying to help the dude out, he's like a brother and he has no family to talk to about this).  Should he just calm down or what?  I'm trying to get him to but he's worried that he's going undiagnosed for something.  He even looked up if cancers can be missed by ultrasound and it easily can which is freaking him out more.  I don't blame him for being nervous.  I've been in his situation before, just not with my balls, and I was misdiagnosed a handful of times before I was better, but it wasn't cancer.  Should he be seeking addition help NOW or wait it out for a bit like his doctor recommends?  He feels like she's just non-concerned with it all and dismissing it.  I just really don't understand how it can appear so inflamed, his doctor even commenting on it, yet the ultrasound comes back normal.If you guys have any follow-up questions, I can text him. `ANSWER: Have him go to a doctor. If it's not better by the end of the week, let that doctor know. There's nothing we can do over the internet that would be better than what the doctor did in person.,I would see what happens with thisdoctor. It sounds like they have done a good work up. `QUESTION: 3 year old with penile pain?[deleted] `ANSWER: As long as he's not crying and complaining about it, can wait until tomorrow. If he starts complaining about the pain again, time to go in and get seen. If possible, I'd really suggest an urgent care that has pediatricians in-office, or your local children's hospital if you have one. `QUESTION: Toddler, 23 months, has blood in his urine, 15mg of ketones, and won't drink anything. Also has been puking and diarrhea.[deleted] `ANSWER: Um, don't ask for advice on the internet for what could be an emergency.  If you're insured, please take your son to the ER or urgent care.,Is he dehydrated, in your opinion? From your description I'd be worried about him and would take him in elsewhere for a second opinion. `QUESTION: Can anyone identify this?My 22 month old woke up with this.  We immediately took him to urgent care and they literally used the word, \"perplexed\" . We are waiting on an appointment on Monday. Any ideas would be helpful.  `ANSWER: It almost looks like prolonged exposure to something very hot. I'm not too sure what else it could be. Best of luck to you and your baby!,Yeah, my first thought was burning lesions, too.The other DD could be some pemphigoid lesion, but the skin color wouldn't be exactly like that.\n",
            "`QUESTION: Sudden swollen preauricular lymph node - healthy 19yo F - is it serious?Just about an hour ago, I noticed that my preauricular lymph node on my left side only was swollen, and the more I examined it, the more painful it felt. It was definitely not there earlier in the evening. It is about 1.5cm large, and hard underneath the surface of my skin - I can only feel it moving around if I'm moving my jaw.I am not currently sick, and feel just fine otherwise. I am not sexually active, so I don't think it's HIV. I hesitate to see a doctor because in two days I will be driving back to college (out of state) and moving in, which makes seeing/communicating with a doctor rather difficult. I also have major health anxiety, so seeing that it could be cancer or a serious virus scared the crap out of me. Is this a likely cause? I have sustained no recent injuries or infections that may have caused the swelling. I do have a bump - unsure if pimple or bug bite- on my (also left) temple that's been mildly oozing yellow liquid, so I don't know if that's related.So my stats:- 19yo- Female- 5'3\" (like 162 cm??)- 135lb- Asian- 1 hour duration so far- Located in front of left ear (lymph node, moderately swollen)- No recent deviation from my general state of healthIf someone could enlighten me on possible causes of this swollen lymoh node (and the probability of cancer), that would be great. I'm just laying in bed, too terrified to sleep, eulogizing myself.Thanks! `ANSWER: It's almost certainly just a lymph node reacting to the mild inflammation at the site of the bug bite/pimple. Your body is doing what is supposed to do - mounting an immune response to keep infection localized to the area of that bite/bump and healing it.,If it is still there in a week, go to the doctor. `QUESTION: Plz help. 23 marble like lump in inner groinIdk what it is... it's very painful and tender to touch.... when I first noticed it , I pressed on it like a retard..... I've applied warm compress and now it looks like it's blistering.... NSFW  https://imgur.com/gallery/YjZcu `ANSWER: It could be a nasty infected ingrown hair. Keep at it with the warm compresses. When it comes to a head, pop it.If it continues to grow, becomes more painful, starts oozing pus or anything like it, it might be a good idea to have a doctor or nurse treat it.,Yup, just like a regular old pimple.,It popped on its own. If you can, rinse it out with warm water. It should heal over the next few days. If it keeps weeping that smelly stuff (that was pus), see a doc. `QUESTION: Not sure whether to get this red patch on my leg checked out?At the beginning of the week I had a bite/spot (can't remember) on my leg - which I thought was normal and so I didn't think anything of it. I went to work, which is outside and in the sun, and throughout the day this red patch appeared. As the day progressed the patch got slowly bigger and more of a solid red colour. Today the redness has gone down and is now a dull red/light brown-ish colour. I'm not sure whether to get this checked out at the doctors or if I should just leave it to sort itself out..!

Is it painful?It looks like a little infection, maybe of a bite or ingrown hair. You don't need to rush to the ER but it's probably a good idea to see your primary care doctor and have it examined. `QUESTION: What is this on my lower leg?Age: 15Sex: MaleWas wondering what this lump on my leg is, it has a little pinch on it which looks like a bite? Not sure if to be worried or not. It showed up yesterday morning. (It gets itchy sometimes) My skin feels hard around it also. Not sure what else to say really. Is this like a flea bite or something? (I have two cats and a dog, my dog has had its monthly flea thing, not sure about my cats though. Picture: http://imgur.com/P1638lg Sorry for the bad quality, taken by my phone with flash.Picture:  `ANSWER: Looks like an ingrown hair/[folliculitis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folliculitis)Mild cases often resolve on their own.  People sometimes use warm compresses several times a day for relief.  Antibiotic creams may be needed from a physician for cases that get worse or persist. `QUESTION: I have this soft bump on the outer side of my left leg but have no idea what it is22, male, 6'2, 240 lbs, caucasianI've had it for a few days now, however I did have one a few weeks ago that went away (in the same spot)When I sit I do put my leg on this bar thing in roughly that exact spot so I'm thinking that is the cause of ithttp://i.imgur.com/UlsDQCC.jpg is a picture of itits filled with blood, I poked it ( okay I picked at it :D ) and it started bleeding `ANSWER: Does it hurt?  Is there any pus from the lesion?It could be a bruise from local trauma, but it could also be a boil that may need to be lanced,It looks like folliculitis.  It's basically an ingrown hair gone wild.  You will live.,You can use some hydrocortisone cream.  That will take care of it. :) `QUESTION: what have i been bitten by?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrwrVKtQ1jEi've check my room, no signs of bedbugs. no other areas of my body have been bitten. sightly painful when i touch it. i woke up this morning to this.living in singapore. `ANSWER: Can't really tell.  Doesn't look like a bite to me.  Looks like you scraped your skin on something. `QUESTION: (22/m) Unsure if the bump on my arm is a bug/spider bite or something elseAround 2 months ago I went on a vacation to St Thomas USVI for a few days and after coming back home I noticed what I thought was a spider-bite on my arm.  It had the two \"fang-like\" marks that certain spider bites have and looked like a crater.  Well, it has since gone through a few cycles of closing up and leaving a raised pink spot, and then later opening again to reveal the crater.  It does not hurt  or itch and it is secreting a clear fluid.  I went to a dermatologist and they recommended to put neosporin and hydrogen peroxide on it twice a day and I have to no avail.So, doctors of reddit.  I'd like for you to try and help me figure out what the hell is on my arm.It opened up again this morning so I've provided a couple of photos. The first one is the crater filled with its secretion, and the next two are photos of it without it. [Pics of what I'm describing](http://imgur.com/a/rHvR8) `ANSWER: Could have been a bite, or a spot, or a little hive you itched to death. Can't tell now, it's just a wound at this point. Neosporin, yes. Hydrogen peroxide, no. The latter is just going to keep opening it back up. Your dermatologist recommend it....so maybe they know something I don't. But, if in the near future you're getting fed up waiting for this to heal .... I'd recommend binning the hydrogen peroxide.Keeping this dry, clean, and uncovered for a week or so, should be enough to clear it up.  `QUESTION: Tiny clear-ish bump on pinky finger. Popped/ripped it off once and it grew back a couple weeks later. [Pics in description]I'm male, 20 years old, 5'11/140lbs, white. Duration = a couple weeks, location is on my pinky finger. [PICS](http://imgur.com/a/dxQl3)I believe it was a few weeks back I noticed this tiny little bump on my pinky finger. I don't remember if it hurt or itched or what, but I decided I didnt like the look of it and I popped it and ripped it off. I remember it bled a surprising amount too.I think it's been about two weeks now, maybe less, and the little bump is back, and it looks exactly like how it started. The bump's surface is clear enough that I can see little red specks underneath the skin. Like really, really tiny specks. Could this be a wart? In my experience the little wart seedlings were always black, and the warts on my fingers were only ever flat to begin with. I figured I should ask before I make any more excavation attempts on this lil' pustule, can anyone tell what this is?  `ANSWER: Looks like an ant bite.  What is in it, clear?,I guess so.  Warts are usually black dots like you mentioned.  These look like small non-inflammed vesicles.  A mild eczema or small ant bite is what I would say.You put your hands into anything recently, wash dishes a lot, get bitten?  Regardless to the answer to these questions, it looks very mild, and will likely self-resolve with no treatment.Was there a hue?  I like a good pinkish hue.  /r/seinfeld  `QUESTION: Guys i got bite by something and i need help confirming what it is[deleted] `ANSWER: It just looks like a pair of infected hair follicles (as opposed to puncture sites from fangs). It doesn't look bad at this point...leave it alone and it will likely resolve. If the redness begins to spread, post follow up pics or go get some antibiotics.  `QUESTION: Can someone tell me what this is?I'm 15 years old, male, 5,8\" tall, 132 lbs, white european from Germany. I got [this](http://imgur.com/n5IX9Sw) for about a week now. Could this be some kind of herpes? `ANSWER: Yep, looks like herpes. The spot you have on your cheek, is that the same or is that more like an old pimple? If it's the same it can also be impetigo, a bacterial skin infection. You would need a special antibacterial ointment for that.  `QUESTION: Bite, ingrown hair, infection?* [one](http://imgur.com/3901epB)* [two](http://imgur.com/9w1QWlY)* [three](http://imgur.com/TVDxF0H)Any idea what these are? The one on my cheek started off as a small scab (maybe a zit or something). I definitely scratched it inadvertently at least once. Since then, it has gotten a bit bigger. It doesn't quite scab over as you can sort of see. The skin feels tight around it. The marks on my jaw (you can sort of see it in all of them, but \"three\" focuses on it – albeit, a bit washed out from the light) are similar to the one on my cheek. Some dead skin/sort-of-a-scab flaked off today leaving some fresh-pink skin.The facial hair is sort of a new thing, so I thought they might be caused by some irritation/ingrown hairs, but that doesn't seem quite right from my previous experiences. I also have about two marks (similar to the stuff on my jaw I suppose) that might be related or simply caused by the irritation of my beard. Any help would be seriously appreciated.  `ANSWER: The ones in the beard look like Tinea, a fungal infection. And I bet that the bigger one is also fungal, but made worse by scratching.You should go to a GP for some anti fungal ointment...\n",
            "`QUESTION: cold sore or what?i thought i was just breaking out but then i was told it could be a cold sore. i looked into it and found out that cold sores are a form of herpes and i got freaked out. i have had similar looking ones for years     the scab at the top of my lip i picked at alot and put peroxide on it. it doesnt look like the pictures i have seen on the internet of cold sores but it doesnt look quite like acne either.     let me know what you think and if its not cold sores what is it?     http://imgur.com/A8fc7kghttp://imgur.com/4KK93gCshttp://imgur.com/bB45WV9shttp://imgur.com/fZeByNMhttp://imgur.com/3rT3ghY `ANSWER: Hard to tell now that it has been picked at. But it is likely a cold sore, especially if you have had them before. For future reference, don't pick or put peroxide on it, they both delay healing. There are over the counter things for cold sores though.  `QUESTION: I have a painless skin bump on my leg. It's been there for a year, and I need a home remedy on how to remove it. I have no insurance atm. Any help? `ANSWER: AgeSexHeightWeightDuration of complaintAny existing relevant medical issues (if any)Current medications (if any)Without more info - It just looks like something (a spot/cut/bite..etc) that you've scratched over and over again, which tore off the scab before it fully healed, leaving a scar. ,Just got a chance to reply now. I hope you haven't gone ahead and sliced it open already...Don't. You'll end up with a bigger scar if you open it back up again. And you're risking infection by creating an unnecessary open wound. And if it does become infected - you'll end up with an even bigger scar when it heals again. You need to leave it alone. Scars take time to fade. If you had insurance my advice would be : If in six months it's still just as raised and red as it is now, go see your doctor and ask to be referred to a plastic surgeon or a dermatologist.  `QUESTION: Self Inflicted Cigar Burn On SkinTo Any Skin Doctor or Expertise,About two years ago In high school my friends and I had the brilliant idea to burn each other with cigars. I've seen it done before and thought it looked cool, but over the years mine bubbled up and now its very noticeable and visually gross. Here are some Pictureshttp://imgur.com/Zxvx3ld (SideView)http://imgur.com/gQMgiEc (Front)http://imgur.com/lTQAzTk (Another Front)Firstly, What are the ways I can remove this off of my skin? And who would i go to see for help with this?Secondly,How much would it cost to get this dime sized bump off of my arm, and how good would it look once its off!Please Help &amp; Thank You For Your Time `ANSWER: You're gonna see a dermatologist, and they may remove it right that day in the office. Like the other fella said, you can expect a scar (probably about the diameter of a cigar). You'll get some goods and some instructions to treat the site with through its healing. Post an update in 6 months. I'm curious about how it'll come out! `QUESTION: 20/M/5`9/ Asian. Is this a cold sore? http://imgur.com/IPlnJ0gI started getting itchiness on my upper lip at 4 am last night and this showed up when I woke up this afternoon. Some possible things that could have triggered it could be the blunt I shared yesterday with my friend and I accidentally drank out of my other friend's cup of water. They both don't have cold sores though. I'm just hoping it's multiple pimples and not a cold sore. Thanks `ANSWER: Certainly looks and sounds like a cold sore. It's incredibly unlikely it was picked up from the blunt or cup you shared yesterday - the time from transmission to first outbreak is much longer than a few hours. There's always the chance it's just pimples or irritated skin. Regardless of cause, just refrain from touching your lip at much as possible. `QUESTION: Painless blister like bump on inside of lipPainless bump on the inside of my bottom lip. I have no idea what it is and I very recently got it. Information or help regarding this is appreciative.http://imgur.com/KN663cDhttp://imgur.com/Hb1mn0chttp://imgur.com/CtKWjUx `ANSWER: You have something called a [mucous cyst](https://www.google.com/search?q=mucous+cyst&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NiWtVPUTytugBIeVgbgD&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=892#tbm=isch&amp;q=mucous+cyst+lip).&gt;[Mucous cysts are common. They are painless, but can be bothersome because you are aware of the bumps in your mouth. The cysts are thought to be caused by sucking the lip membranes between the teeth.](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001639.htm)Call and schedule an appointment with a physician to get it removed (they are really gentle, and will have even more time to take you out of pain before you let it get to an emergency).If left like that it has a chance of becoming inflamed due to infection and it will be a rather unpleasant ER trip. Much more comfortable to do it in the controlled surgeons office rather than a busy ER.I hope this helped. Best of luck! `QUESTION: What's up with my lip?Hi there. I recently got knocked super hard in the jaw by a small child on accident. I bit my lip and it swelled up and made a very very painful bump. A week later the bump is deflated and is now a raw patch of skin. It hurts and keeps getting this yellowish film over it. What can I do to help it? `ANSWER: Leave it alone &amp; maintain proper oral hygiene. Without a picture, I can only assume the trauma has left a little ulcer - which will heal on it's own without any treatment.,Upload to [IMGUR](https://imgur.com/) and post the link to the picture here. ,Yep, an ulcer. Looks fine though. Will take a week or two to clear up completely.  `QUESTION: Got knocked off my bicycle yesterday and scraped my arm. EMT cleaned and bandaged it. Can someone take a look and tell me if this looks okay?[Pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/b9r1c) First four were taken an hour ago, immediately after washing it with soap and water, the last four just a few minutes ago. Not sure if it's clear from the pictures, but it's presently oozing clear fluid.I briefly tried cleaning it with hydrogen peroxide yesterday, before finding out that I'm apparently not supposed to do that. Cleaned it a few times since with soap and water, but that's all I've done.Does it look normal? Should I be doing anything else to treat it? `ANSWER: Bit of an abrasion. Keep it clean and covered while it's oozing. Water is fine to clean it with. You can expect that to dry out and scab over in the next few days. If it starts becoming quite an angry red, or oozing blood/lots of pus, or if it becomes exquisitely painful/swells up, check it out with a doc but it looks the sort of thing that should heal on its own with no problem and minimal scarring if you don't pick at it. `QUESTION: I cut my fingertip two weeks ago while cooking and I’d like to make sure it’s healing correctly. I don’t want it to end up rotting off and needing to get my thumb amputatedHeight: 5'11\"Male 21 yrs oldUSA154 lbsCut my finger on Jan 24thNo medical issuesI swabbed it with alcohol and kept it bandaged for a couple days. It opened a few times in those first couple daysThe area directly above the cut and up to the black line drawn in is dead. At this point much of it has hardened and the area up to the line is numb. Feels fine, doesn’t hurt or smell. Thankshttps://imgur.com/a/Aapb93i `ANSWER: Is that a skin flap? As in the top of your finger could fold up and the underneath exposed? If so... Can you expose the underside? That is a deep cut and should be evaluated by a physician regardless, but I think it may be healing as well as possible. ,That looks okay. The black area will get absorbed or that flap will scar up and fall off. Keep it clean and watch for infection - redness, warmth, pain, swelling. ,Yeah the black part does not look necrotic it looks like old blood. It has re-fused? Interesting. I do think it should be seen in person but again I do actually think it is healing well surprisingly. ,The parts of the flap that don't have a blood supply will fall off, the parts that do will heal. Just watch for signs of infection and you should be fine.  `QUESTION: What is this? Looks like a zit... but inside my mouth.http://i.imgur.com/eYcd5Vs.jpg?2It's kind of hard to see, but it is clear on the top. I haven't popped it b/c I don't know what it is. But it bothers me b/c it is easy to feel with my tongue. It doesn't hurt like a canker sore. Just curious, thanks!   `ANSWER: I agree with pinky.Don't pop it. Just take it easy and let your mouth heal on it's own. Your mouth heals fast. `QUESTION: Dry lips from cold weather turned into a large red area below my mouth, anything I can do to help?http://i.imgur.com/aIeFQhd.jpgIt looks even worse in other lighting, too. I'm a native Texan going to college in the east coast so I'm pretty sensitive to cold weather, and my lips get chapped for a period of a few days every other week or so. Sometimes it spreads down and there's a bit of redness and peeling, but this is the furthest it's gone. It's been about a week since the dryness started on a particularly cold day, and it's been like it is in that picture for about four days now, although at this point it feels like the skin in that area is starting to die off.I haven't used any moisturizers or anything because 1. I'm broke, 2. I haven't had time to go to the store in the first place, and 3. I don't want to accidentally make something worse since I haven't found anything online about this specific problem. I'm already on top of the typical things like drinking water and not rubbing/scratching it. `ANSWER: Just get a couple of tubes of chapstick and have one on you at all times.  Use it on your lips and that area that is now reddened.  It will heal.  Continue using the chapstick constantly till the dry weather is over.I have chapstick in my car, my bathroom, my nightstand, my desk, etc.  It's the only way I don't end up with awfully chapped lips during the windy season here. `QUESTION: Busted my lip and need advice on how to heal it properly!I fell off my bike and busted my lip. I got four stitches on the inside, and just scratches on the outside. It is quite swollen and hard. I am hoping to get some advice on how make it heal faster, and ensure that the bump goes down and my lip regains its original form. THANKS![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/dDxZhUM.jpg)[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/CUyK81M)I know these are shit, but I am guessing not that important. `ANSWER: Wash and wait.Time is the only factor here.\n",
            "`QUESTION: Marijuana and GlandsHello, everyone. I'm here to ask about something I have been experiencing for a while now.When I smoke marijuana, I get a lump under the left side of my jaw under my ear. This lump is never present when I refrain from smoking, and goes away once I am no longer under the influence of pot. It is not in my head, it is completely real.Is this something to worry about? I couldn't find much about this online. I thought maybe my lungs were messed up somehow, but tobacco smoke does not cause the same results. I rarely smoke cigarettes, just something I noticed. Thank you for your time.  `ANSWER: Sounds like it could be a reactive lymph node.  I suppose it depends on how long it is enlarged for and exactly where it is.Lymph nodes can get enlarged with infections, cancers and things that cause inflammation.Normally, if a lymph node becomes enlarged, it will stay that way for a few days in the case of infection or longer (ie cancer, etc).  If the lump is enlarging and disappearing in a matter of minutes/hours, it's probably not a lymph node.,I can't tell you what it means because I don't know.  But a reactive lymph node is my best guess.Unexplained enlarged lymph nodes warrant a check up by a doctor, but they are most worrisome when they get big and stay big, not if they fluctuate. `QUESTION: Have had Swollen Lymph Nodes for about a year but no symptoms of weight loss, night sweats or anything. Anyone know why I still have this?So yea, this is probably my 2nd post of the day(hopefully this'll be the last for now). Hello again! I am an 18-year old dude, weigh about 60+ KG(or 140+ in lbs), height is about 5'8. I've had this swollen lymph node, particularly its the submental and submandibular lymph nodes(the ones of the neck/below chin)? For about, I dont know. A year? Noticed it randomly, touched it by accident, hasn't caused me a great concern til recently. No known symptoms, haven't lost weight. Still the same 60+ KG from before. Fatigue? Nope. Nightsweats, not really? Should I be concerned about this or not? I keep touching it since its freaking me out.. Should I stop touching it? Will there be great side effects if I keep touching these swollen things? Also, what do you guys think I should do about this? `ANSWER: A persistent lymph node in that area for a year warrants seeing a physician and probably bloodwork if not done so already.At your age the cause is probably benign or unknown, but needs a professional opinion.,Worst case scenarios (but much more rare) would be things like lymphomas and head and necks cancers.More common causes are things like chronic infections mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, etc.A lot of the time, no cause is identified and doctors just keep an eye on them via imaging and bloodwork to make sure they don't get bigger or worse. `QUESTION: Do I have swollen lymph nodes in my neck or is that my neck muscles?I'm a 26 year old white male 6' 165 pounds.  A couple months ago i noticed when my neck is relaxed and i put my index finger under one side of my jawline and my thumb on the other i can feel lumps. I can kind of move them around. When i press my tongue to the rough of my mouth both sides stick out. I am very paranoid and am grabbing my neck all the time during the day.  Is this just muscles in my neck that I have never noticed before? `ANSWER: 1. Yes. that seems to be lymph nodes2. Most certainly you are fine. It's ok for lymph nodes to be palpable. *Edit:* You say they \"stick out\". Can you take a picture of that or estimate the size?3. If you are worried anyway, have them checked by any doctor (I bet even a dentist could do that). You could also wait until your next doctor's appointment and then ask if he/she could check your submandibular lymph nodes since you're worried.4. Stop touching them daily – Pressing and squeezing them regularly is a perfect way to let them stay bigger because they react to what you do to them. **stick to only checking them every fortnight**.Hope I could help &amp; best wishes*Edit:*Are you a smoker? Ex-smoker? How many pack-years?Do you drink spirits? And how much?Before you first noticed the lumps, have you had a throat or mouth infection?Have you lost weight recently?Do you sweat at night in a way that you have to change your sheets in the morning?How many Lumps can you palpate?Are any other lymph nodes on your neck palpable?,What about the rough size and the amount of ~~the~~ lump(s)?,Hmm.. could also be your salivary glands. I still think you're save but have it checked anyway. `QUESTION: Doctor looked at my lymph nodes and said that it was more than likely from fighting something off, but I'm still scared.[deleted] `ANSWER: 9/10 times, lymph node enlargement isn't anything serious, and is a normal part of immune response.  Also, keep in mind that lymph nodes can remain enlarged for prolonged periods of time without a pathological basis. Basically, unless you have redness, tenderness or pain in the area, I wouldn't worry too much about it. `QUESTION: Swollen lump in base of neckHi. About 3 weeks ago I started feeling a swollen lump on the left side of my neck at the base just above the clavicle. I assumed it was just a swollen lymph node but it didn't go away. It tends to fluctuate in size and it seems like the more I touch it, the larger it gets for some time. It is very tender and can be somewhat painful when pushed.I went to see a doctor a few days ago and he was relatively sure it was just a lymph node from a latent infection. He did request a blood test just for peace of mind though. I have not received the test back yet. My concern is due to the fact that I have never had that particular node swollen and no lymph node swelling has ever lasted more than a few days with me, let alone 3 weeks.The lump is pliable and I did have some pain radiating down my arm a few days ago, though it passed. Currently, it's a bit uncomfortable to move my neck (not painful though).It seems to have gotten a little larger overall and more tender since my doctor visit. Does anyone have any idea what this could be?Additional info:23 year old male.Had orthognathic surgery about 4-5 years ago.Recently had an ear infection on the same side as the lump, though it's completely gone now and the ear was examined by the doctor.Currently having very mild seasonal allergies.Otherwise, completely healthy. `ANSWER: infections can cause lymph nodes to swell, so it's not weird to have an enlarged lymphnode after your ear infection. Lymph nodes are sensitive to manipulation: if you rub and feel them a lot, they get irritated and get larger. I suppose your underlying message is a cancer scare, and I read some very reassuring things in your story: 1. cancer never gets smaller on its own, so fluctuating size is a good sign. 2. cancer lymph nodes don't hurt, inflamed nodes do. So you can wait for the results and then let the node go away on it's on. The usual waiting time before performing any kind of biopsy in my country (NL) is 6 weeks.  `QUESTION: Mildly enlarged lymph node in neck (POSSIBLY)[deleted] `ANSWER: Think of your lymph nodes as filters for your body.  They catch germs and bacteria and keep them from getting you sick(er).  Its normal for them to swell during and directly after that process, its just not normal for them to stay that way and they shouldn't be hard. ,Not being hard is a good thing and the fact that you can feel it means its swollen. Thats what enlarged means in this case. ,There wouldn't be any question. It would feel like a rock under your skin.  No reason to think it would be, I just mentioned it as what to look for that would indeed be concerning.  What you're describing sounds like very typical symptoms for someone getting over a viral or bacterial illness.  ,You should see a dentist soon though, don't wait too long.  The longer you go without getting them fixed the worse they will be and the more costly.   `QUESTION: Swollen lymph for 6+ months?I'm a 22 year old female in the UK. I've had a swollen lymph in my neck since around December (or around then). I had blood tests done in December, nothing strange (also had chest scan in October for shoulder pain, again nothing strange). I went back to the doctor last week and had more blood tests done, again nothing flagged up, and I don't think I've had any other symptoms. But my doctor wants to refer me to a haematologist because of the length of time I've had the swollen gland - the thing is that I'm flying to America in 2 days and will be there for nearly 3 months. So my question, basically, is do you think I have a lot to worry about? Is it worth cancelling my flight or should I just go see the haematologist when I get back?Any advice appreciated!Edit: I'm of normal height and weight and I'm not on any medication except the contraceptive pill (microgynon). `ANSWER: Hi there!The short answer to your question is; let your doctor know you are leaving for 3 months. The long answer is; your doctor likely wants to get a piece of the node (called a biopsy) to see if there might be cancer inside. At 6+ months and allowing two followups, it may be time to investigate this further. Some doctors even go by sayings like \"painless lymph nodes on one side of the neck are cancer until proven otherwise\". Lymphomas would be one type of cancer that can cause such swelling, and unless you have symptoms that you didn't mention, the initial treatment may be \"watchful waiting\" at first anyway. You need to decide if this is something important to you. However, if you do decide to take the trip, at least call the office and let them know. It's not great to have a patient you are worried or curious about suddenly drop off the planet.- Please be aware that I am a physician in training, a recently graduated MD and Internal Medicine resident. I am contributing to /r/AskDocs to satisfy my own intellectual curiosity.,Not sure how the NHS works, but can you not pop in and get a biopsy done before you leave? Functionally it's a pretty simple process, and if you're going away for 3 months you don't want to be worrying about it while you're overseas. `QUESTION: Went to ER cause of extreme pain in right side of throat when swallowing. Discovered 1.7 cm lymph node is causing the pain. Now worriedHello. I’m a 27 year old male. 6’0No medical history190 pounds(weight) African AmericanA couple weeks ago I had a sore throat. Didn’t mean much, it was just a sore throat. However I developed pain in the roof of my mouth and congestion after the sore throat was gone. I felt pain in the back of my right throat(as I do now) but it was more of the roof pain that bothered me the most and was more consistent. My ENT prescribed Clarithromycin and the roof pain went away. The pain in general had started to go away However I have now developed this serious pain whenever I swallow on the right side of throat more consistently now. Literally the pain came back out of nowhere. I started feeling my neck and discovered a lump. Went to the ER and they did a ultrasound. Discovered I had a 1.7cm Lymph node causing the pain, along with other lymph nodes. The doctor said it was reactive and just fighting an infection but the problem is the cold I had already left, and again, I was feeling the pain in the ride side of my throat even then but just not as consistent. I’m a bit confused, and scared.It would be just my luck that my ENT doctor is currently on vacation so I have to wait a bit longer to see him(I’m usually able to see him fast)  now my mind is stuck. Last year, I had a fan biopsy on the left side of my throat after lymph nodes were discovered. They tested negative for cancer and everything was fine. The reason I had this test was cause I felt pain in my neck whenever I drink beer. Knowing about lymphoma, I immediately went and got test done. That was the left side of my throat. Now on my right side, I’m unsure. Any thoughts from the doctors here? I’m a bit afraid even though I’m trying not to be `ANSWER: Don't worry dude, sounds like a reactive lymph node. The ultrasound appearance suggests that they saw other nodes as well, which you'd expect from an infection but not from cancer. Lymph nodes can stick around for a few weeks after the infection, that's totally normal. It's reasonable to get a follow up ultrasound to make sure it goes away, but I wouldn't freak out about it at all.  `QUESTION: [Q] Swollen behind my right ear, slight pain - picturesSo I was at my friends house when she noticed I was quite swollen behind my ear (I have no idea what the spot is called, but it's circular and slightly soft when normal). - [Picture of the spot when it looks normal.](http://i.imgur.com/K4KCTZy.jpg) *my left side (normal)*My right side is however swollen, slight pain and warm - [Picture of swollen spot](http://i.imgur.com/KuzfXUj.jpg) *my left side (swollen)*This is barely noticeable on pictures but my friend noticed it easily 13 feet away.Does anyone know what might be causing it it I should seek medical care?Age: 26Sex: MDuration of complaint: 2-3 daysLocation (Geographic and on body): Behind right ear, on the soft circular area `ANSWER: Looks like a swollen lymph node/cyst.You have lymph nodes that run in a track all across the back of your head/neck. An infection is the most common reason for a lymph node to swell up. Since it is painful that indicates it is more than likely an infection rather than something more serious than cancer. Is this your only symptom? Are there any more lumps/bumps like this? Are you a lot more fatigued than normal? Have you lost weight unexpectedly recently? Any night sweats? I guess what I am asking is for changes you might not think to mention.Like I said it is more than likely a localized infection. Lymph nodes are responsible for draining infection from areas, so if you've had a sore throat/cough/sniffles or any head/throat cold recently that would explain the lymphadenopathy.  ---Still find your way into a doctors office **if it doesn't go down in about a week.** You can try a hot compress on it a few times a day to encourage that.,&gt;I got the flu 3-4 weeks ago.Sounds like a suspect. Like I said if she doesn't work her way down within about 7 days call and schedule a checkup. You're more than welcome! `QUESTION: Just needed to know if this is \"normal\"- and ideally, why.The last 6-9 months, my (F,35) lymph nodes in my armpits painfully swell up about once a month, take about a week to go back to normal. When it first started happening, I went to an urgent care clinic (I knew lumps in armpits could mean breast cancer, and wanted to get checked out), and they said it was normal- they said it was my lymph nodes, and not cancer. I haven't been back since, so my questions are:1- is this, really, normal? This was a walk-in clinic after all, I feel like I should take it with a grain of salt.2- why would it start now?3- what could be causing this? Because when they said it was normal, I had figured it would go away after a bit, and it keeps happening every month.I'm not having any other adverse reactions out of normal, if I was I'd just try a doctor again. Just trying to figure out if this should be concerning me. Thanks in advance for any help. If more info is necessary, I'll try to supply what I can. `ANSWER: This can be normal. This is happening every month, does it coincide with your medstrual cycle? Painful lymph nodes are nothing to worry about. This can happen with you have changes in hormones, when your body is trying to fight infections, etc. Lymph node enlargement should only be concerning if there is no pain. Painful lymphnodes are actually a good sign. Non-painful nodes are the ones you need to worry about. I wouldn't worry too much. ,99% of the time painful lymph nodes rule out cancer. Swelling of lymph nodes that coincide with a menstrual cycle is typically normal for women in this age group. ,Lymph node enlargement with changes in hormones is normal. Its very common among women in their late twenties and mid to early thirty. You can discuss this with your OBGYN and see what options you have for treatment. Sometimes taking birth control pills can help. Just out of curiosity when you feel this lymph node is it deep in your armpit, or is it more on the outside close to your breast?  `QUESTION: Just needed to know if this is \"normal\"- and ideally, why.The last 6-9 months, my (F,35) lymph nodes in my armpits painfully swell up about once a month, take about a week to go back to normal.

            "`QUESTION: When do boys stop growing?I'm a 15 year old boy (turning 16 in september) and I'm only f iv e feet three inches. I recently went to the doctor for a routine check up and she said that since I had only grown about half an inch since last year \"I was about done growing.\" I was really disappointed because I have a really inconvenient height I'm not tall enough for most adult things like adult bikes and stuff. Am I really done growing? I hear that most guys continue to grow into their early twenties, but I'm beginning to think that growth is a bit insignificant and the bulk of it is done before my age so when is the bulk of male growth in height done between the ages of? also I'm already taller than my 5'1\" mom but every one on my dad's side is at least six feet with the exception of him who is about 5'8\" how tall am I likely to grow? What can I do to increase my chances of growing taller? `ANSWER: The growth plates on bones can start the process of hardening between 17 and the early 20s. Once those harden, you are \"done\" growing. I wouldn't worry much. Although your parent's are of slightly smaller height. ,Not really. It is just a natural body process. `QUESTION: Testosterone QuestionI was redirected here. What is a good natural source to produce more testosterone in my body? (Atm im taking a good amount of coconut milk, protein, go the gym, maintain a healthy diet, etc.)My goal being here to be more manly. I dnt plan to raise my testosterone levels like a lot higher just enough to deepen my voice a bit and help with growth. Im currently 17, meaning im still going through puberty and what not, and from my understanding an increased amount of testosterone will do as I have stated. But an overdose can have negative effects. Correct me if im wrong. `ANSWER: All bodies are different, all men are different. Unless you have a suspicion that you're not going through puberty (no secondary sex characteristics at all, no body height increase), don't worry.,Your body will make what it needs to. All those things you are doing will not raise testosterone levels nor will the millions of supplements that claim to. /u/Ulsenius is spot on.,I don't think you understand that the human body just doesn't work like you think it does. Ding those things will not result in a large surge of testosterone. That's not what all the research says. `QUESTION: Are there any ways reduce one's height as as an adult, safe or unsafe?The only things I could think of were...-osteoporosis-anorexia (maybe)-calcium deficiencies-HRT (if you're a MTF, then you see a height change with the blockage of testosterone)Are there any other (non-surgical) ways to reduce one's height as an adult, including even diseases/etc.?  `ANSWER: Well you should know that height comes from your bones. So to become shorter, you would have to somehow destroy the bones. You can either cut out a piece of your legs (however no sane doctor will ever do that since it can come with a LOT of other problems), it happens if someone has a spine fracture (then the vertebrae can collaps, for example in people with severe osteoporosis), and that is about it. All causes you mention are ways to reduce the strength of the bones. now I have a return question: why would you want to know this? `QUESTION: Can I still grow?Hello, im a male teenager whos 16 in a few months and I feel as if I have wasted my growing years as I didnt really eat much. Im starting to eat more but im 5' 9\" and only 125. Im half asian half white and dont really have an armpit hair really (not visible really) and I dont have any facial hair as in beard area, maybe a very weak mustache if I didnt do anything to it... amyways is there still opportunity for me to grow (taller, bigger, etc) my dad is 5'11\" and my mom is 5'7\" Thanks for reading, a comment would be appreciated. `ANSWER: Typical male growth can be all the way up until you are 19-21 years old but most males are done growing by 16 following a big growth spurt. You do still have an opportunity to grow if your some of your growth plates are still open. Your primary care physician can order xrays of a few joints to see if the growth plates are still open. ,It all depends on genetics and what genes you have inherited. In layman's terms, who knows.  `QUESTION: I don't know if this belongs here, but...I'm a 14 year old male. A bit too young to use reddit, I guess. Anyway, this is another one of those questions about puberty. Recently, I went to the doctor after an x ray on my hand, and he said I was done with puberty because my growth plates were closed/closing. I'm not the height I want to be and my endowment isn't the size I'd like it to be- I just want to know if I still grow in some ways after the plates close. I see the submission rules, so I'm a white male that's 14 and 5 foot 10, and I'm 200 pounds even. I'm sorry if it's a bad question in advance, this is a throwaway for a reason. `ANSWER: Hey dude, I have to disagree. So long as they can see the growth plates then there is time. As you go through puberty, these plates \"ossify\" or turn into bone. You're only 14. You've still got plenty of time. A good 4-8 years I would say. However, to help you reach your maximal height, try and optimise your \"environmental\" factors, the biggest of which is eating a healthy balanced diet and trying to bring down your weight because that can significantly contribute to not achieving your maximal potential.All the best :) `QUESTION: Should i take HGH as a short teenager ?I'm a 15 year old male who is 166cm. I've had a growth spurt when I was 12(not really early) and haven't grown much since. I'm extremely worried about my height and considering to take hormones/powder/medicine to increase height. Would you consider/recommend it. If not why and what can i do that can actually help me get taller than my intended genes. `ANSWER: The simple answer is no. Don't take any kind of hormone supplement. You are 15 years old&gt;[The average 18-year-old-male is 68 to 70 in \\(170 to 180 cm\\)](http://teens.lovetoknow.com/Average_Height_and_Weight_for_Teenager)Drink a lot of milk and make healthy diet choices and you will grow. Male development doesn't stop until you are around 18. **Don't take hormones; they have nasty side effects**&gt; [Up to 30% of patients experience side effects that include fluid retention, joint and muscle pain, carpal tunnel syndrome \\(pressure on the nerve in the wrist causing hand pain and numbness\\), and high blood sugar levels.](http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletters/Harvard_Mens_Health_Watch/2010/May/growth-hormone-athletic-performance-and-aging) `QUESTION: Small growth spurt and returning facial acne at 25?25 year old male. I had terrible acne as a teenager but it mostly cleared up around 19-20 YO. Within the last few months though, for whatever reason I've grown about ~1.5 inches to be 6ft and the acne has returned though not as terrible as my teenage years. I don't really have anyone to compare my situation to in my family as I'm by far the tallest now among all the closest branches. Not sure if there's a positive correlation but I was almost absurdly short up to 16 (when my acne was at my worse) to grow near a foot over the course of the year. Is this that abnormal a thing? Currently I'm using benzoyl peroxide and a retinol for self-treatment. `ANSWER: Is it only that your are getting taller, or are your hands, feet, ears and/or yaw also growing? ,Sorry, jaw. English is not my first language. anyway, you need to go see an endocrinologist and have him/her check your growth hormone levels (and of course the other hormones that are secreted by your pituitary gland). High growth hormone levels are a common cause for this kind of adult growth. `QUESTION: Can I grow?[deleted] `ANSWER: Your growth plates have not fused. You can still grow.I don't know what the effects of hormone blockers are on growth, so I can't comment on that. I do know that HGH is the hormone that governs growth. Testosterone/estrogen have an effect on growth, but that mostly affects muscle tone and body shape.Ask your mother how long she noticed she still grew. How tall is she? I'm referring to your mother since your assigned sex is female and you are not on hormones to transition. Look at the women in your family and it will give an indication on how tall you might become.In my case, I (female) had my last growth spurt of about 2 cm when I was 20. ,Since you're 15 and your growth plates have not fused, you have a good chance of still growing quite a bit. Don't worry just yet :) `QUESTION: HGH to increase height?Can hgh help to increase height if im 18? if so what are the requirements in order to obtain a prescription from the doctor for HGH? `ANSWER: Obtaining a prescription for HGH is not as simple as saying \"I want to be taller\". You would need to see an endocrinologist and be an abnormally short stature. Plus at 18, the growth plates in your bones have started to fuse if they haven't already.,This. Additionally, most endocrinologists will only prescribe HGH in growth hormone deficiency, not in idiopathic short stature (because it doesn't work that well in those cases). `QUESTION: I've created a collection of amino acids and supplements that could potentially increase my release of HGH to 2000%-4000% what could be the consequences of executing this?I am under 18, so my plates have not yet closed.  `ANSWER: You would develop Acromegaly, also known as Gigantism. It would have drastic effects on bone growth, fertility, muscle development, and several hormonal regulating systems in your body like sugar balance and insulin. You can check out the Wikipedia article on [Acromegaly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acromegaly) for more information.  `QUESTION: I've created a collection of amino acids and supplements that could potentially increase my release of HGH to 2000%-4000% what could be the consequences of executing this?I am under 18, so my plates have not yet closed.  `ANSWER: You would develop Acromegaly, also known as Gigantism.

I've been taking paroxetine extended release (25mg) for the last 2 years; however I no longer have health or prescription insursance.Smart me went to Mexico and bought myself some normal paroxetine (20mg) until I get health insurance in November. What I'm here for is basically advice over how I should dose this with my current 25mg xr. Fwiw I also have about 2 months supply of 15 mg paxil xr but also don't know how to cover myself.So in summary, I have these options:- 7 days of paxil xr 25 mg- 2 months of paxil xr 15 mg- 20 days of REGULAR paxil 20 mg.- 5 zanax 1 mg.Help me avoid withdrawal syndrome. `ANSWER: I'm not a doc but am in a field where I have pretty good general knowledge about psych meds.  I think you can mix and match and approximate the dose your body is used to. It's Ok for the dose to go up and down a bit, so long as it averages out to what you're used to, 175 mg per week.  So maybe this sequence over 7 days: 1) 25 mg Xr   2) 2 15 mg xr   3) 20 mg regular.   4) 2 15 mg xr. 5) 15 mg xr6) 2 15 mg xr.  7) 20 mg regular `QUESTION: I took my e-mycin two hours lateI took my second dose just under two hours after I was supposed to (I forgot but I'll make a timetable in future). Will this have any negative effects on my skin or the treatment? Male, 5'10, 18 `ANSWER: Nope,Depends on the prescription but assuming you’re taking the usual 4x a day, the time division isn’t as important as long as the total intake doesn’t exceed approx. 4g. Just ensure you complete the course and space it evenly so that you complete the days’ course. ,Worst case scenario it’s better if you don’t take the pill you missed and just take the next dose whenever you were supposed to. It’s better than taking them all at once, playing catch-up. ,No I understand, I meant IF you missed your 7am dose, and remembered at 6pm, don’t take the morning dose then, just take your scheduled evening dose at 7pm. Random timings as an example. ,If it’s a one time thing, nothing would happen. Constantly doing it would put your liver and kidney into override because they metabolise the drugs and increase the chances of side effects if they’re unable to metabolise them efficiently.  `QUESTION: Caffeine pills- I love them, but are there risks?I don't drink coffee, soda, or tea. I recently started taking caffeine pills and they make me feel amazing: full of energy, alert, happy, etc. Are there any downsides or long term risks?  200mg pills `ANSWER: How many pills per day?,Unlikely to cause any harm long term at this dose. Likewise in the short term. As long as it's not affecting your sleep, giving you the shakes, tummy trouble (diarrhea), or increased anxiety. EDIT: I'm assuming you're a relatively healthy adult, with no major health concerns.  `QUESTION: Possible ibuprofen overdose?!Yesterday I sprained my ankle. None of the doctors are open on a weekend where I am from so at the moment I am just taking ibuprofen.I have a feeling I could of overdosed and taken to many. Yesterday at 3pm I took 400mg, then at 9 pm the pain got quite bad so I took 400mg then again at 3am I took 400mg. Today at 1pm I have just taken 800mg accidently. I was not thinking straight and I took a double does within 2 hours of each other. So 1pm today I took 400mg, then forgetting I had taken the 400mg I took another at 3pm. So in the space of 24 hours I have taken 2000mg of ibuprofen. Should I seek medical help immediately?28 years old. 150 pounds, Don't drink or smoke. No underlying health conditions that I know of.  `ANSWER: I don't expect any toxic effects with a single dose of 2000mg/24 hours. If you feel unwell (vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion, headache, drowsiness, vertigo, diplopia), contact a doctor.Please be careful when using medication in the future.,Given the half life of ibuprofen (2 hours) I would wait at least 10 hours (5 times the half life) before taking another dose. Then, only use 400mg three times a day.You can use paracetamol (acetaminophen) together with ibuprofen, that way you don't have to use such a high dose of ibuprofen.,The maximum daily dose of ibuprofen in 2400mg, so you are within that limit, so should be safe to continue taking ibuprofen 400-800mg three times daily. Though I wouldn't recommend taking the higher dose for more than a couple of days.Adding paracetamol is a good idea, and you can always use regular ice and elevating the limb,2400mg? Where? Where I practise, the maximum daily dose is 1200mg (or 1600mg for joint disease or postoperative pain),I work in the UK, and our formulary references (BNF or MIMMS), allow for dosages up to 2.4g per 24hrs.  Though, 3.2g daily seems to be a possible maximum dose from some US sources.1.2-1.8g daily seems to be the standard max dose for non-physicians or non-prescription, over the counter preparations - I assume as the risk of side effects increases beyond that dose, such that taking the higher doses should be for short and/or monitored periods,Interesting. I'm in the Netherlands, and our formularium lists the same maximum daily dose (1200mg) as the package inserts for OTC ibuprofen, with exceptions for joint disease (1600mg or temporarily 3000mg in severe cases). http://www.farmacotherapeutischkompas.nl/preparaatteksten/i/ibuprofen.asp `QUESTION: Residual worry about possible acetaminophen overdose?First, I want to give the disclaimer that I do currently know that high doses of acetaminophen are toxic to the liver, and I would not purposely take a dose that was more than the recommended maximum published on the bottle. But I wasn't always this smart.So when I was around 15-16 and was lifting weights to prep for high school football I had a lot of chronic back pain. To help me push through I would take tylenol when things got unbearable. But, one day it was so unbearable that I doubled the daily max dosage, about 8,000mg.The first thing that most people assume is that I became super sick from an overdose level of tylenol, and that I ended up having to go to the hospital for acute liver failure. But that never happened. I experienced no pain, discomfort, nausea, fatigue or any other symptoms as best I can remember.Jump forward and I'm now going on 26. I learned of the real dangers related to acetaminophen overdose between then and now, and always wondered what really went on, but I've never asked a doctor. From the research I've done I understand that I probably killed quite a few liver cells, but the liver is a unique organ and can regenerate, so most likely any damage done was repaired with a few months, especially given that it wasn't serious enough to hospitalize me.Am I correct in my assumptions that most likely things are fine considering they've been fine for 10 years, or should I be trying to find my way onto a liver transplant list? Also before someone makes the comments (1) yes I know it was stupid to take that much tylenol, but everyone is 'smarter' at 15 (2) no, it was not an attempt at suicide and now I'm second guessing things, I'm really not concerned with breeding attention for myself by trying to convince everyone I'm not suicidal. Demographics -Age: 25Sex: MaleWeight: 217Height: 5'11\"Race/Ethnicity: WhiteDuration: ~Location: ~Current Medications: NoneMedical Issues: None `ANSWER: You'll be fine. No need to go hunting for livers on the black market. , Higher doses of acetaminophen are associated with higher risk of toxicity, but the toxicity is acute. If you made it through without symptoms, you likely took a low enough dose that you did no damage. Maybe if you'd had liver enzyme levels checked they would have been elevated a few days after, but maybe not. You got lucky! For all the talk about the deadliness of Tylenol overdoses, many people do survive.I'm not a toxicologist and I don't know if the risk is linear or not, but 10 mg in a day is a point where many, but not all, people suffer serious toxicity. It depends somewhat on size/weight as well.,If you just took it, I think the most likely long-term effect is death. That's a high dose that requires immediate medical attention.If this was years ago, you got very lucky. The effects could range from, somehow, none to a barely functioning liver, and there's no way for us to know. `QUESTION: URGENT! Possible paracetamol overdoseI've taken 9 500mg paracetamol tablets over the past 24 hours - is this dangerous?I took two at 10:00pm last night, then two at 7:15am then next day. On the same day I took one at 12:20pm, then another two at 4:30pm. After that I took two at 8:30pm.That's 9 tablets in 24 hours, is this serious? `ANSWER: The recommended 24 hour intake for acetaminophen is 3,000 mg, so yes, that's too much.I can only advise you get to a doctor now, and *especially* if you've had alcohol as well.Please follow the directions on the bottle for proper dosage.,OK that's good. You're still 1,500 mg over the recommended safe dosage.,Yes that's too much. As Gullex said, I'd advise you to go to the doctor as soon as you can. ,Of course it's possible, but it's not recommended. I can't in good conscience advise that you put off a doctor's visit, but you do what you gotta do.,Judging by the GCSE comment you're in the UK. Pop down to A&amp;E and let someone assess you, at this time of night there will be nobody there. This is technically a staggered overdose. Whether you need treatment or not requires a PROPER assessment to make this decision. ,Could call poison control on the box to ask for advice,In the US we routinely use 4,000mg as the maximum 24hr dose for a healthy adult. I wouldsay that 4,500mg in a 24hr period, one time, in a healthy person, is extremely unlikely to cause any significant issue. `QUESTION: How much ibuprofen can you safely take in a day?Simple enough question. Asking for my wife. 37 years, 155 pounds, 5'7\". Very fit and healthy. `ANSWER: It's fine to take 800mg (4 over-the-counter tablets) every 6 hours (so 4 times per day). It's not something I'd recommend for more than 1-2 days, because there are some serious long-term consequences. (This is assuming she doesn't have risk factors for stomach bleeds, or some of the other bad side effects, in which case even that amount could be dangerous. It's still generally safe when used for a short amount of time, though.),I agree with limiting scheduled high doses to a few days, but I generally wouldn't recommend going over 400 mg every 4-6 hours without advice from your physician. Of course, 800 mg is generally an acceptable dose for prescribed ibuprofen. Can't say I'm not guilty of using such a dose for myself.  `QUESTION: Did I Take Too Much Calcium?Background 5'6155 lbsHispanicI was just wondering how much calcium it would take to start becoming unsafe. I recently suffered from a pretty heavy electrolyte imbalance a few weeks ago, as a result of overhydrating myself into hyponytremia, and then dehydrating myself after.  Not sure if that has any bearing on this. I went to my doctor the other day to follow up on my condition since I've been experiencing fatigue still, and some numbness and tingling in my feet.  Based on my labs he said that I may be deficient in magnesium. He suggested magnesium supplement or a multivitamin with magnesium. I didn't have any magnesium supplements at home but I did have a Kirkland calcium, magnesium and zinc supplement. 500mg calcium total. Together with my food, including milk and  yogurt, I think I've collectively eaten around 1500-1800 mg maybe even 2000, but that's pushing it  Tonight I ate some spinach, about 150 grams of it. Then went to the store about 40 minutes laterWhen I was in the checkout lane I started getting cloudy headed, and lower in energy and a slight headache. I was feeling relatively good before. I'm just wondering if the amount if the amount of calcium I have consumed should worry me. Thank you. `ANSWER: Nah, you're fine. The total daily recommended intake for anyone over 50 is 1200mg (at least in Canada). You won't overdose at 2000mg. I'd cut back though.If you're hypomag, pick up some Mag oxide 420mg tabs and take 1-2\\day depending on your level.Also how old are you, and how bad was your hyponatremia? `QUESTION: I accidentally took too much Tylenol following tooth extraction. Is my liver going to be ok?[deleted] `ANSWER: 8 grams of Tylenol isn't going to kill you, especially if it's a one time thing,If you haven't got any symptoms, you'll probably be alright. Lay off the tylenol for a bit. How old are you? How much do you weigh? You say you took the Tylenol over one day, but how staggered was it? Do you drink alcohol? Any other medications, or medical conditions?Evidence suggests if you weigh more than 54kg, you're likely to be fine as a one-off thing. `QUESTION: Too Much Acetomenaphin?Okay, so I'm not sure if I took too much Mucinex Fast-Max. I don't have symptoms and it's 20 minutes since my last dose.* At 1 PM the 19th I took a dose* at 5PM the 19th I took a dose* at 10PM the 19th I took a dose* at 10 am the 20th I took a doise* at 4 PM the 20th I took a dose* at 9 PM the 20th I took a dose* Today at 3am I took a doseI have no symptoms but I feel like I might be overreacting? What are the side effects to an overdose? I'm scared to go to sleep. Am I overreacting?* Age: 20* Sex Male:* Height 5'10* Weight: 140* Race: Caucasian* Location: USA `ANSWER: What does the packaging say about dosage?,Well, you certainly haven't passed the 6 doses in 24 hours bit. I doubt you've got an overdose of any sort.,I wouldn't say overreacting. You're probably right about the shakiness coming from not having eaten in a while. Have something to eat and see if it goes away.,You'd have to take a lot of acetaminophen *in one go* to get overdose symptoms. The time between doses is recommended this way so some of the acetaminophen is metabolised before adding more to your system. You have nothing to worry about.,Not fully, but for the most part.Stop worrying, you have no overdose.,I though standard dose is 650mg-1000mg TID + PRN?  `QUESTION: Accidentally took 2 doses of tecta?I'm supposed to take 40mg of tecta daily, but I accidentally took it twice so I took 80mg in total, is that OK? `ANSWER: yes, you will be fine.\n"
